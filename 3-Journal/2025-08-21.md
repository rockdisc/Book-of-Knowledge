## Classes 

### US History 
We went through a slideshow in the class about why Europeans went to the [[New World]]. Before that we went over our slideshows. 
### Honors Accelerated Pre-Calc 
We had a review lesson [[1.4 hapc.pdf]] about [[Polynomials]].

We had a talk at the PAC, the sports head got really pumped about not wanting to get second again. I read the book afterward.

We learned about the night sky by taking notes. It was mainly definitions like of [[Eclipse]]s and the such.
