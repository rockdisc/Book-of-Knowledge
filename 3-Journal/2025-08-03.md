I did not do that much today, I will do more tomorrow. I had dnd and did not want to do anything that much. I made the ai model run locally on my device, which was fun to have, though I realize now that there is no reason to have it better than what I already have. It is like having an internet without internet, it will be the same even if I add the commands, but it would just be over complicating it. I still might try is. I think I should try to make everything I use run on my laptop. I already have note, the internet, and music on my laptop, what else can it be. The more I get into the world of technology, the more I realize that it is easier to get away from big service providers and the internet in general.
