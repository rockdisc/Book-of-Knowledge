So I was right, I did not do anything today, aside from getting a new laptop. This is a LG Gram, it is mainly the same as my old one, aside from the fact that the screen is much better and it has a terabyte of storage. Other smaller differences are that it has a number pad on the keyboard which means that I have to rethink how I type, this is probably going to take a few hours to get used to, after that it should be good. The mouse pad is worse, but that is ok, most of the time I use this I will have a mouse with me. I want to get back into the flow of writing things tomorrow as it has been a long two day break. I kind of have to as I have a dnd session on Sunday. I am also thinking of putting my calendar on here in some way shape or for to get the benefit of having all of my note taking and scheduling in one place though I do not know if I will ever get to doing that. I started using times new roman as a font in this, I really like the serifs, if I find a better font I might use it.
