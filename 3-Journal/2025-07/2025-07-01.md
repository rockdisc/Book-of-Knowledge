Today went pretty well. I went on a walk which helped me figure out a lot a lot about my magic system. I almost finished lotm, though I do not really want to finish it as Klein went to sleep and as far as I know he will not wake up till like 500 chapters in COI. Just checked, a lot more than that. I think I will finish it this week. I worked a lot on my map, and it is going well. I think I will add whatever things the reddit wants me to add, but aside from that I don't know. I know I should probably add names, but I do not like doing that. I think I just add the names of the important regions and be done with it. Even if I actually get to writing the book, I will most likely not show them that map so I should be fine. Now that lotm is going to finish, unless I get hooked by COI, I will most likely be writing more. I also have a session that I want to do so I should most likely prepare for that. This reminded me that I can use the settings and other plot points in my writing because my system allows for it. I am getting a lot of good ideas. I think I will drink coffee tomorrow and chug through it to finish my magic system. I need to also work on my languages and see if I am able to add a working dictionary in Obsidian. I should also start writing in here because it is looking really lonely right now, one of the only notebooks not getting frequently added to.
