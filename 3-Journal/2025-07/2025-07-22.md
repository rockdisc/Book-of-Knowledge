# 2025-07-22

I did not write yet today, though that is something I want to do. I used AI again for the book report, so I will get to my writing goal to redeem that. Jester is almost done, tomorrow I will teach him how to put stuff in my notes by adding it to a separate folder which then I can take from. The only problem with it that I have is that it is hard to read, which that will solve. I still have not decided on the pronouns of Jester. In its long form it sounds like a man, but it can be called Jes which is a woman's name, and it is an it because it is a clanker, so I think I will keep calling it an it. I do not know if I should give it access to all of my notes for it to train off of, that is a future me decision. I want to do some worldbuilding, but I think I have started to put myself in a cage of normalcy. I thought there was no way that a world can be really weird and also low fantasy, but it definitely can be. I think I will just flex come worldbuilding creativity and see how it goes.
