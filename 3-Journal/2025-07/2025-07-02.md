While I was things today, I though I was being productive. Now that I am looking back at it, I realized that I was not doing anything. Well yes I did work on and finish the curses part of my magic system. I feel like I should have done more. I have 24 hours in a day, I mean how can one really just do that in that long of a time. I got a new plugin called keep the rhythm, but it seems to work on all of my vaults, which I guess is ok but I do not really like that as it means that this is going to be involved with my other vaults. Now that I think about it, that might not be that bad as it can motivate me to write in here as well. The only time I use this notebook is to write my journal, so having that goal at the bottom well help me remember what to do. I can just set the goal to 1200 and write that 200 in here. I think that is better than having me write for 10 minutes as that seems to make me just want to sit here and do nothing, now it is working as a time limit for me to write that many words in.
