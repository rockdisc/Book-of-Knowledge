# 2025-07-11

Today was something. I did not do a lot today, just enough to think as though I did something, and I am ok with that. The only problem I have is that I did not write today as much as I wanted to. But that is alright because I have listened to a lot more of shadow slave. I think I can finish it by the end of break. I have been thinking of switching to Linux, though thinking about it more, it seems like more of a hassle to do so as there are a few things that do not work on Linux that I would like to use. I think I will do so when I get a new laptop. I backed up everything today in case something happens. I think I have started living in the moment more. I should continue my current trends and do something everyday so I can feel like I am doing something. The book notes will be helpful in the future as long as I fill them with interesting ideas from those books and not just a summary. I should also start doing mini essays in here or in the other notebook to flesh out my world as well as get me into the writing flow.
