Today was weird, I mean I am writing this in bed at 11 pm because I did not have the time too, I toured [[Wichita University]] today and it was really good, I can see myself going there as that tuition and distance is good. I talked to a physics faculty member and they were very helpful though it seemed that they were not the keenest to me not knowing that much about physics. I made a new theme for obsidian and I think I will keep using it, as I coded it, I can change whatever I want whenever I please. I did not get to my writing goal yesterday for this notebook, and I will not get to my writing goal for my other today, but I think that is fine as it is just for me to write, I do not want to feel as though I need to do a set amount of words or I did not do anything in day. I am also thinking of starting to use vim key binds as it will make it easy for me to write faster and more productively, there is that buzz word again, I think that I should learn vim and start using it in my writing. The best way of doing that is activating it right now and hoping I figure out what I am doing by tomorrow.
