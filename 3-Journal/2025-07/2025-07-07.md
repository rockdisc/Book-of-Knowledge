Dnd went great today. I got through everything I planned and the players liked it. I feel like I did a lot today, I started using this vault to take notes on what I am learning. I am using professor Dave to learn and by taking notes, I think I am getting it in my head. [[Kinematics]] is pretty easy as it reminds me of [[Chemistry]], and all of its rules. I think I will continue with physics and add everything I learn in there, at least going through 1 topic a day. Then I will go back and add everything I know about other topics too. I got that 1000 word goal done on my book worldbuilding. I think I will start working on the nations and cultures as I am starting to feel burnt out when working on the magic system, and it is like 90% done. I can come back to it when I feel the calling or I want something to change. I feel I am falling into a trap of everything needs to be productive, I am already a workaholic, I think this might be making it worse, though I cannot see myself doing anything aside from this, at least it makes me feel good.
