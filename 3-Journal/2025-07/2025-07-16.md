# 2025-07-16

Today was a fun day. I did not get as much as I wanted to but that is ok because I hung out with friends, which is what I will be doing tomorrow as well. I want to write, I have not done anything with my book for a while and it is just sitting there like a one to one copy of lotm. The best way for that not to be the case is to show the difference pretty early on, to be fair I do not really care if it resembles it too much as I am making my own thing with it. All of this is possible only if I write it to begin with. Ok I got distracted in the middle of this and edited the first chapter. I really what to do something with this though I do not know what. I got myself involved in other people's problems again, it is yet again because of that kid, this time I can hopefully stop this without blame falling on anyone. Since when was I his caretaker. Its fine though I do not have to put too much effort into it so it is hopefully ok.
