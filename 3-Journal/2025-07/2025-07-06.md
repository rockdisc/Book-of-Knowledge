__Yesterday's Note:__[[2025-07-05]]

I did a lot of writing today. Sitting down and just writing is working for me right now, though I do not know how long it will be continuing to that. I have dnd tomorrow I should probably prep for that, but I do not want to. I got my draft of the prologue done. I think it is going well, I can see myself continuing the story. I need to keep writing, as I can see myself doing nothing else. I got a new browser, Opera GX was good but I think Vivaldi is going to be better. I do not know if it is just me thinking, but it may be a bit slower that Opera. At the same time it seems faster. It is very customizable, the biggest problem is that my cache is gone, which meant my notes on some of the characters, but I think it is ok. I want to learn physics, I am going to [[Wichita University]] in a few days, I hope that I can talk to the physics staff about some concepts good enough. It is really something how my brain works, sometimes things that are less productive in the long term seem to be more productive in the short term.
