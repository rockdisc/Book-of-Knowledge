# 2025-07-15

I am writing pretty late today, it is almost tomorrow. Yes I know this is bad and I had most of the day to write, but I am almost half way done with shadow slave. I think I should be able to finish by the start of school at this pace. I think my writings are starting to blossom as I am writing more on my book reports and tomorrow I will be writing a lot for my physics stuff. Looking at more literature is really helping me gain more ideas I can put into my own work whenever I get started on that. I scheduled dnd for next Monday, though I know that I will have a lot of things to do in the next few days, I will most likely get started on Sunday. It has been a while since I have had coffee, I think I should have to and get some work done like getting the first chapter done. I think I will publish my book on Web Novel, I do not think it will go anywhere, but I want people other than my friends to be able to see my work. Though this means I have to get a few chapters done so I can maintain weekly uploads even if I lag behind.
