# 2025-07-12

I just did a pro gamer move, I put all of my notes into GitHub, now I can just sync whenever I am done and it will be saved on 3 different things, my laptop, my MacBook, and Git. This will hopefully make sure that I never lose this. this also means that I can access this on other devices, oh what I do instead of using a notebook. It is really not that hard though, I probably should have done it the moment I started writing in here. The debate camp went well today, I have a lot of work to do to have an aff ready.  I feel that this is getting cluttered, so I think I will start chopping down the things I have in here. On the MacBook I have to used Vim to do my notes, which is fine and all, it actually seems fine to use. I just need to add plugins if I can tomorrow so I have the basics of a text editor. Now that all of my notebooks are safe away from my hands, I feel better about if this laptop were to die, which in the case I have to check with the people if my laptop is fixable.
