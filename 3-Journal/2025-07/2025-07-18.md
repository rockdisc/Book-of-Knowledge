# 2025-07-18

I went to [[Kansas University]] today and realized that I did not have a college report for so that seems like a next week thing. It went pretty well, though I do not know if I want to go there are it seems almost too big. I am yet again thinking of switching to Linux, I think after I get a deal on this, I will see if switching will lower the price of this laptop. Using [[Linux X Windows]], I realized I really do not use a laptop for that much, but what I do use is for is very important. I think by having a good Idea in my head before switching it would be good, like finding a good wallpaper to base everything off of. The ones I have right now are fine, but they can be better. I also signed up for a python course over several weeks, I do not think it will take me that much time to learn it, but it is better to know it than not. I think I should find a good motivator, same with my book, before it was lotm, but I took too much inspiration. I should find a way of getting ideas from all over the place.
