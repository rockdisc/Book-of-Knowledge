Ok so I completely forgot that I have a college visit tomorrow, but that is ok, this one is to [[K State]] so it does not really matter, I will not be going to it anyway. I want to code something to help me with obsidian but I do not know what. Well I guess I should say me whole thought process: I want my laptop to just be everything I need and no other clutter, just a web browser, obsidian, and a few games, specifically Trackmania and Roblox. Of course it should also include the other necessities like a good terminal and file manager when I want GUI. I think the best way to get this is by switching to Linux, though I do not know if I want to do it. If I am getting rid of this laptop, then yes I will switch to Linux in my new one, but it would be annoying of I got rid of Windows. I think I am able to maybe configure windows to when that is what it can do, it should ne easy enough though tedious. That is a project for another day.
