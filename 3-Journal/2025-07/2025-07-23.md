> Motivation is the right to want what your parents were never allowed to reach for. Its the quiet fire that returns what your nervous system finally believes your safe enough to want again, and if you can't move today, that doesn't mean you failed, it means you listened to the ache, to the memory, to the silence you had when you were tired, because you don't go searching for motivation, you go searching for yourself and that part of you that doesn't speak when the world stops listening is still learning, it is not un-motivated. You are allowed to want without surviving first.

# 2025-07-23

I did not think I did anything today, but I think today will be very helpful to me in the future. I made Jester be able to scan notes and pdfs, day by day my AI is getting stronger and stronger. All of the classical physics playlist is done, so I think that I will start watching AP guide videos. I reorganized the vault, now there is place for my rambling, of course I called it ramblings. My system is a version of PARA and zottlekasten combined. I did not like the archives of PARA and only took the research from the other. I am thinking of trying Emacs just to see how it goes. If it is good, I will switch to it. I have found a bit more of what I wanted with my worldbuilding, which helped a lot with my sense of writer's block. I am consuming so much, I think I need to slow down for a day and regurgitate it like a bird. I went to Paymore, nothing happened, and I will book an appointment with the laptop repair guy soon. I have realized that I have probably gone through a fourth of my life, though my brain does not want to admit it.
