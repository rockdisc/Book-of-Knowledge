# 2025-07-29

Yes I did not do that much today, but I did everything that I had to, so I am okay with it. I want to keep going though, I want to get to a point where I can easily complete everything I want to do and do it. I finished the Shadow Slave audiobook, I want to take a break from audiobooks and start writing for a bit to feel something again. I might go to those only manga recap channels and see how they are doing. I am also looking for a new laptop, when I get it, I will most likely stick with windows for a bit then switch to Linux, just so I can get used to my new laptop. I want to actually set up what my day to day will be when I start school. I got pictures taken of the CDs, so I am now just going to put it on marketplace. I feel myself going into the maws of procrastination again, hopefully I can fix that by tomorrow, you know what they say, just do it. Honestly it might be the phone. I want to back up my laptop again tomorrow, at least I saved my notes to git.
