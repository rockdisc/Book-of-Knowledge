I am going down the productive rabbit hole again. I got a different plugin because the other one is, for some reason, shared between files. Which is really lame. So this one is a bit different and does not track over a long period of time, though it seems to be working great for what I need it to do. I am using the other one on my book worldbuilding as it will be much more useful there, as I write on a lot of different files there. I had the first debate camp thing today, it went well, I think I will keep doing it till more people show up. I didn't write yesterday, I came home from watching the fireworks and I was too occupied with wanting to watch LOTM what I forgot to write. I want to do more things, as I did nothing today. I just didn't feel like doing anything. I should just sit my ass down at my desk and start writing. I also want to start COI soon. I have starting on getting the start of the book written, it is going well so far but I do not know how long that is going to last. I just want to write.
