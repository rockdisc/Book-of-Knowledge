# 2025-07-26

I did not do anything special today, I did not download Emacs to try it again, I did not write the fable about the crow and the owl, all I did was go to the library for the debate camp and got the book. I am alright with all of this though, because I believe that I can do everything else another day. I like having a lot of things to do, it makes me feel safe from the [[Nothing]]. I think I will start to look at the AP physics guides to see what they say in case I missed something. It feels nice not trying to make all of my day productive, yet it feels off, like I am not doing everything I can, because I am not doing everything I can, and that is ok. I will not do much tomorrow either, I will go to the college class, then I will go to the laptop guy and see what is wrong with my laptop. Reading feels weird after all of this time, I am more used to reading online, I like it, but I think I still have some bad memories of having to read because of school. Hopefully reading on my own will make they less of a case.
