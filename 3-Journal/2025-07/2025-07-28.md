# 2025-07-28

Believe it or not I hung out with friends at the mall today. Now it just makes me think that it slowed me down from writing. Shadow slave is about to end, I need to talk to the guys about dnd and get started on planning it. I also need to talk to Paymore to see if they would take my laptop. I really need to find another laptop. I also want to remake the desert thing to be a short horror story to see how it would be, or just as a writing exercise. In general, just make it longer. I also want to actually start writing the fable. There are so many things I want to and have to do, but by body does not want to do anything. I need some coffee, I will get some tomorrow, I will also do most of these things tomorrow. I do not know when I started to get less used to human interaction again, but it feels weird. I feel like a completely different person when I am around somebody else. I need to also book the library. I should read the book earlier in the day so that I can get more reading done, I think it will be better after I finish shadow slave.
