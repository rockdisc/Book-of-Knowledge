I am on a drive right now. It is pretty fun, I have mainly been writing this entire day. It is what I will be doing tomorrow as well. I have been learning a new concept in physics everyday and it has been fun, giving myself that goal is really helping me figure everything out. I want to finish the classical physics videos from Professor Dave Explains before the summer ends. I am kind of scared to see what the physics staff is going to say, I have only learned the basics of physics and they might dismantle my dreams, though if they try to do that, it will just aggravate me and I will work even harder to be a physicist. There is really not that much I did today, I think that is ok, I need to stop myself from trying to be productive everyday and just enjoy life.
