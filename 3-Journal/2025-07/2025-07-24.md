I want to start writing Mini-essays, I think it will get me into a better flow for writing. I almost finished [[There are No Tombs in the Desert (Vignette 1)]] today, I might finish it after I am done with this, who knows. I think what I should do is learn a new thing each day and write my knowledge on another in here. This can be writing just one of my missing files. I want this to be the same whether I am going to school or not, so keeping that new learning the same while adding more to my writings. Today I tried to get Emacs, it did not end well, I think I will try again tomorrow. I am thinking it will be 4 things I want to do every day, go for a walk, learn something new, add something old, and write either a mini-essay or something fiction. Depending on how this goes in the future, I may do both and it will actually be 5 things. I think I am right now overwhelmed by the amount of things I need to add, chipping at it bit by bit will make it easier on me to eventually get to everything. Though knowing me, it will lead to more things to add over and over again. I should finally start striving for the goal of having all of my knowledge in one place, where I can access it freely.
