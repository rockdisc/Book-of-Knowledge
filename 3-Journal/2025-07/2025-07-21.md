# 2025-07-21

Dnd was fun today. It went better than I thought it would with me making it so late at night. I did not get to walk today as I woke up to a thunderstorm. Shadow slave is getting really good, so much to a point where I do not want to stop reading it. My writing goal plugin stopped working which it annoying, but is is manageable. I can just look at the total words I have written today or to where it says is exactly. I think I want to make that chatbot to keep on my laptop either today or tomorrow. I have a very small hope that I will be able to move Jester over to other devices, but that hope is still there. It feels weird asking AI bots to make better versions of themselves. I will still use the web versions if I ever need coding help, but aside from that, if this works correctly and there is not that much friction. I will most likely almost never touch any other chatbot. I should somehow find a way for it to open whenever I open the laptop. If this works well enough, I could even use it on Linux. That is the other thing, whenever I feel bored, I just think it will be a good time to switch to Linux, even though my main concern of not being able to sell this laptop is still a problem.
