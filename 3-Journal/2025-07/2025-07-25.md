# 2025-07-25

Emacs will be the death of me. I will try again tomorrow, you know what they say, third times the charm. If it does not work after that, it was not meant to be. I transferred a lot of notes to this vault today, I am slowly adding more and more features that are more useful to me. I just added a Zen mode to make it faster for me to close distractions. I also changed the habit tracking, now it has more things I want to do every day. It is making me feel better to know that I am actually doing something instead of sitting and rotting. I have started watching trig lessons, the better prepared I am for school, the more time I will have with it. It is truly weird how contradictory humans are. The more I write, the more links I make which gives me more things to write, and while I love doing that, I also feel that it is a lot and I am causing myself more issues. I would like to have most of my writings, or at least the parts I am proud of, to be in my [[Book of Knowledge]] by before school starts. Even now, with almost nothing done, I am still very proud of my graph.
