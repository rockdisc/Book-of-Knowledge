I hate my allergies so much. I forgot to take my Zyrtec this morning on my walk and low and behold, 3 nosebleeds and so, so much snot. I think it is really lame. I did not want to do any work today, so I did not do any work today. By work, I specifically mean writing. I instead watched how to train your dragon, the good movies. It was in fact, very good. I think me being sick allowed me to forgive myself for not working and just watching something for a change. It felt very different. Normally I only let myself only watch videos and do nothing else when I am eating and about to sleep. I mean specifically long form videos as I still doom scroll every so often. I did get a lot of work done on dnd, so that is good. I still need to plan all of my session I have in a few days, but it should be much easier when I have a storyboard done. I am also sleeping early today, though I do not think that means I will actually be sleeping earlier than I normally do. I want to get some good work done tomorrow, however much that is. I do not want to have some stupid excuse, I will most likely not go for a walk or go to the gym so I do need something to do. I want that 1000 words done.
