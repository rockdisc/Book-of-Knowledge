# 2025-07-14

Today was better for both my writings, though I still wrote them pretty late. I have been very invested by shadow slave that I did not want to stop listening to it. I still have around 3/4 of is to go which it very surprising but I think very nice. I would like to take notes of what I read, but then again I really do not want to as that is just more friction to do what I like. I do not have to spend all my day being productive, though that does not mean I should spend my whole day lazing around. I changed my wallpapers today, though that in fact did not help. I think that nothing will work till I finish shadow slave, or it will be a shadow haunting me till I do so. Writing was easier for me today, I feel that urge to get back into writing again, and I am happy to see it. I want to get more writing done, whether that be just for my book or other small stories I want to write. I think I will add another folder here someday just for my writings.
