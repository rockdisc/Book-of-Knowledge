Yet again I am writing this late at night from the comfort of my bed. I have not been keeping track of the sentence journal, which is ironic as it is the one that takes less time commitment. I have slowed down on my writing, I need to pick it back up. I have started on chapter 1 of my book, hopefully it goes well and I do not stop there as I did with the last one. This one has more planning going into it though I do not know how helpful it will be. I feel it is too close to lotm, though I feel it is something everyone feels when writing a story, I have major changes that are not like lotm, I feel I am just regurgitating from that one series. I have started listening to shadow slave and it is pretty good, I want to continue with COI but I do not feel up to the task right now. I think what I will do to counter act the feeling of not consuming any media is start using this notebook to write about 1 new piece of media a day, in the morning as I am taking my walk I can watch a video about that piece of media and come back to comment on it. Who needs to write right now I think I will set up a habit tracker on here as I am definitely not doing it in-person for walks, physics, gym, writing, and studying.
