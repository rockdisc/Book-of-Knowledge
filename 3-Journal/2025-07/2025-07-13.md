# 2025-07-13

I almost forgot to write today, but I didn't. I feel like I don't want to write my book reports and physics stuff, but I think if I get past this stage and keep doing it, it will be easier for me. I will start actually watching those videos the day of making the reports so I remembered more information and maybe do more for physics. This journal is proof that if I pass the stage of not wanting to do it, I will do it for as long as I remember. It seems like a hassle to do it right now even though I know it will be good for me in the future, I think I will have to do the hack my brain strategies to make sure I do it. Like moving to my other desk or changing my desktop wallpaper. I do want to get a new wallpaper, something I make, though I do not know how good it will be, my last one was fine, but I want something both useful and artistic. I do not know if that will ever be the case though I can try, I think to start that I should start using vim again.
