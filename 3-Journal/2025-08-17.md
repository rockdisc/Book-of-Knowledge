I did my first video report today. It gave me a lot of good ideas to do. I want to get more done in a shorter amount of time, like everybody. I am starting later than I wanted though. That is ok, as long as I keep it up in the long run I will not miss out. I had a hang out with friends for debate and made a rough draft of my aff. I just need to cut all the cards for it. I see myself becoming more distracted. Luckily I have learned how to stop doing that. I think for the next few weeks I will try to continue this schedule and see how it goes. I hope that it will result in me doing things faster. I will also have to start learning how to spread. It is not at all good right now, but I want to be able to do it by start of the season. I will also have to revise the session plans for dnd, but that should not take more than an hour. I will try to do so in school, though I do not know if that will work out.
