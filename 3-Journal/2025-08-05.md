I did not do anything today either, but I think it will let do a lot more later. I created hotkeys and desktops while also fleshing out Spotify. I also went to to dentist, I will go again in 6 months. I want to edit the right click menu in Obsidian, it seems too much as of right now and all I use it for is spell check. I installed a new theme which is everything I wanted with just some things I have to get used to like having narrow headings and some visual differences. But the benefits out way the negatives. I have gone into the flow of now wanting everything to be a keyboard shortcut, but I know that I should not have that and what I have currently is more than enough. I will get back into everything tomorrow.
