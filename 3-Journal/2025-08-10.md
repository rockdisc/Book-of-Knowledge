# 2025-08-10

I was outside the entire time and am getting nothing done. I might get writing done tonight. I got some hoodies and clothes. India fest was pretty fun. I got three campus notebooks for school. they are up to hype. They are probably some of the best notebooks I have ever used. School is starting in three days, I am semi looking forward to it. I want to rebuild my reading and writing habit again by then. I also need to sent the councilor that email by tomorrow so I can get my schedule fixed. I got a lot of things to do, but first I want to clean my room, in turn cleaning my mind. I have found another audiobook for COI so I will be keeping up with that as I am doing the rest.
