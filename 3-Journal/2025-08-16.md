Ok I did not do anything today, and I will not do anything tomorrow aside from working on my aff. I think actually using weekends as a break will be good for me. I cleaned my desk, tomorrow I will clean my other desk. I did go on a walk and go to the temple. I am having a lot of fun going into random notes. I can see myself doing this in the future. I think I would also like to format my notes in the future  to work on MacBook.
