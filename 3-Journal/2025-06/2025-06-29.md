I got to find a good second carrier choice to go down. I say this while knowing damn well that I will just forget about it till I find something I want to do. But what is the problem with that? Yeah I didn't do a lot of writing today, there were just a lot more things I wanted to do, like watch the new Creepcast video. The problem is that that video is 11 hours long. I will finish it tonight. I need to get a good idea for the elves in my book. Right now a have the gods as a final goal for most people to try and reach to with their own twists. I think the way I incorporate elves is by the rituals to advance. Something like they need rituals to get stronger while the ikons use the results of the ritual to get their strength. I will have to research rituals to do this. I see why people research topics for their books. It seems like a hassle though. I will still do it, I am just hoping my laziness does not kick in. The map is going well.
