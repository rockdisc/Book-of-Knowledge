Yeah I think it will be progressive to be humbler. I went to the gym today. I did not work as hard as I wanted to. I think I will have to build up to it. I almost didn't write this journal today as I was falling 1 min late. I don't know why I am so caught up in that. I think that if I didn't start I would not write for the next bit. I started the new Obsidian page for the book worldbuilding and hopefully it goes well. I have the college planning tomorrow, aside from that I have nothing. I want to get a lot of stuff done tomorrow, hopefully I am able to. I went to Paymore today, they said they will take a lot of stuff. Some day I will go back and give them the piles of e-waste that is in my house. I found an old camcorder, I think I will start taking it to tournaments and record things in it. I found my old 3ds pictures, I thought I lost those. I am going to give away the tablet that I had, I never used it for anything important. Hopefully I get at least $10. I have gotten a lot more into writing, I think it is better for me. I can slow down my thinking when it needs to and can speed up my thinking when it needs to. I was about to get scolded by James (the older one) most likely because I was not communicating. But that is fine, because I actually did. I will book the room tomorrow so it can be open for us. I have this weird feeling of wanting to do something but not being able. I want to stop that feeling.
