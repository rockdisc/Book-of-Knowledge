I stopped and thought. Not deeply though. I have realized that I did not like my magic system so I will change it once more. I think I get a dopamine response when I restart things because it feels like cleaning a mess. LOTM is going to release in 1 hour I cannot be more exited, though you would not see that on my face. I think I have stopped showing real happiness to things, I do not know why. I really want to watch LOTM but why is there that feeling again to not do anything. What does this mean. Why do I want to be nothing. I think it is because I am scared. I am scared of being where I am not, I am scared of being where I am. I am scared of not even being enough. As Kendrick said in PRIDE. "Maybe I wasn't there." That is how that deep part of my brain feels. I do not know why. I need to strive to make myself better and get down my ego. Yea I am going to call it my ego. ==My ego is making me scared to be where I am because it is scared of where I am not.== This is a problem, I problem I know how to solve but not how to solve it. I need to get humble.
