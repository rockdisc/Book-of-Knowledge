## Classes 

### AP English Language Arts

### Spanish 2 
Got to LF2, it is still words about what makes you happy.
### AST
I did nothing, just doom scrolled. 
### AP Physics 1 
We learned about [[Deriving Kinematics Equations]], and looked at our acceleration lab, which I finished after school.

More information about the tournament schedule. I will have to work on my [[Affirmative|Aff]] while my partner works of the [[Negative]].

I did it, I did all of my tasks today. Even after spending way too much time on physics stuff. I had a really interesting lesson in physics today, so I spent most of the day trying to derive the equations we use. Even with that and a few glitches on my writing tracker, I still got my goal words per day before even writing this. I would like to continue this train for at least this week, but we will see how tomorrow will be. I am just giving myself more work to do, which I would like to think is good, but I see that there are things that are just not being done, but would just take not even half a day to do. I think one of these days I have to do that.
