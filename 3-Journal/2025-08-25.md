## Classes 

### AP English Language Arts 
Looked at [[SPACECAT]], which is a way of [[Rhetorical Analysis]], but more in-depth. Next class we will use it on the writing we did in class. /We also learned about [[CER]]
### Spanish 2 
Got to LF2, it is still words about what makes you happy.
### AST
I did nothing, just doom scrolled. 
### AP Physics 1 
We learned about [[Deriving Kinematics Equations]], and looked at our acceleration lab, which I finished after school.

More information about the tournament schedule. I will have to work on my [[Affirmative|Aff]] while my partner works of the [[Negative]].
