I am back. I did not write yesterday and I almost did not write today. I don't really know how I feel right now, I have a lot to do, but I do not want to do any of it. More accurately, I do not have the energy to do any of it. I think I will take it slow for a few days. That is a lie, I know I will be jumping in head first tomorrow and hoping I get everything done before I go out to buy things for school. I think switching to Linux, or at least dual booting for a bit will help me with my slog. This is not even writers block, more of my mental state not being well enough to do something. I think I need a dopamine detox or something similar as I cannot find myself doing something otherwise. Thinking about it more now I see that the world is truly trying to take advantage of our brains just to get more money. I want to do things tomorrow, I want to be able to write without staring at my phone. I will try to go without music, though I do not know how well that would go. The habit tracking is seeming to help, though I have not been going to the gym. That might be a weekly thing at this point.
