# 2025-08-23

I made the session today. I also am trying a new spell checker, let's see how it goes. I realized that it is kind of lame right now, I will probably only turn it on after I am done writing. All of my regular writings, like this one, do not need it. I use so many fake words that I believe it will be tedious. I failed in pomodoro today, that is ok though, because I will try again tomorrow. And the day after that, and the day after that, till I get it down. The first 25 minutes are not hard, the next are also pretty easy, but from that point is the issue. I checked to see how fast obsidian loads, with my current setup, which I will most likely not change, it takes about 10 seconds to start up. I would like it quicker, but it is ok for now. I realize that there is a lot of things within my rough folder. I have a lot of work to do in the future. Which is nice, I think I am close to finding writing things I know relaxing. I think I should start using properties more, they seem like a really good feature I have just been trying to ignore.
