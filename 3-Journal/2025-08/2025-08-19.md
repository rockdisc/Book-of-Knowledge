We learned about [[Concavity]]. We went through lesson 1.2 and 1.3 which I was able to finish with time left, so I worked on debate. Speaking of which I was able to give him the form. We also learned about the [[Average Rate of Change]]
### Astronomy 
We did some basic things like how the Earth moves. It is nothing I need to take notes for, though I should start writing notes on astronomy as there is a lot to write.
