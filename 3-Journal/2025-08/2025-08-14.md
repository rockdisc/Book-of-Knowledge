Yeah school is hard. I feel like my classes go from me learning things to me sitting doing nothing. I will have to start doing something in those classes unless I want to feel empty. I have this weekend free, I think I will figure something out to do in those classes. I need to clean my desk by the end of the weekend. I want it to reflect who I am as a person, same with my room, and it is not doing that right now. There are a lot of things I want to do, but a lot of them I just don't. I think I will try to separate myself from watching videos that do not impact me in any way. I have time in school, I should use it. I look at my notes, and I want to organize them again, even though I know that they are already pretty well organized. I think if I have access to my laptop I will clone my notes and pull them whenever necessary, then on a different file started changing things about them. I should be able to write just to write if I do not have access to it.
