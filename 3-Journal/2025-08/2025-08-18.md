I did a lot more things today. I think tomorrow I will be a able to finally check off everything on the list. I should get back to watching anime, it is really fun. I should not focus on taking notes, yes I like doing it and it is good to do, but I should focus on learning, then recalling everything. I did not do everything I wanted to do on the today listing, but I will tomorrow. They are just a few things that should be done. I feel really happy today. I think going into deep work and getting everything done is a thing I should keep doing. If I can manage to do that everyday I should have a lot more free time to do everything else. I was able to write what happened in two hard classes in less than 15 minutes. I do not know what I will do for Spanish, I do not want to have the entire language in this notebook, but it would also be helpful. I think I should think about it more. I want to try and get homework done the week I get it so that I do not fall into the late work trap again.
