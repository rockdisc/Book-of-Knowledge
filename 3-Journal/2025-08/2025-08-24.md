# 2025-08-24

I had the session today, people were bored during it. I was not able to get everything I wanted to do out of it. That is fine because I learned from it. I think I should stop being so angry. I did not do much else today, I customized a new app that I realized I did not want to use. I think having the next session be more exciting would be good, for both groups. School is starting again, I did not do the physics homework, it is not due yet, but I think I can do in, and finish it, during AST. I realize there are a lot of things I want to do with this notebook, I just got the idea to take notes on Creepcast episodes as the newest one was really good. But I already have so much to do. I think I should start taking notes on what I think about. That way I can get into my own head and know what to do. That will show what my prioraties are in my head. Then again that is such a hastle to do. I will definately not be updating it what so ever. I want to try out Linux, the more I sit on it, the more appealing it looks. I should have time next weekend to try, judging that I will most likely have less to prepare for dnd.
