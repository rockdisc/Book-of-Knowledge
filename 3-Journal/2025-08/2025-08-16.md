Ok I did not do anything today, and I will not do anything tomorrow aside from working on my aff. I think actually using weekends as a break will be good for me. I cleaned my desk, tomorrow I will clean my other desk. I did go on a walk and go to the temple. I am having a lot of fun going into random notes. I can see myself doing this in the future. I think I would also like to format my notes in the future  to work on MacBook. I really want to finish book two of lotm soon. I always have writing that book in the backlog, except I do nothing before that so it is always staying there. I am more comfortable with doing more things now while also being comfortable doing nothing. Those two things seem to be related like they are the same mindset. I am not comfortable making references to media I consume even though it fits this occasion. I do not know why it happens, but I do not feel the inclination to change it. I think it is just cringe to do so in those circumstances. In other spots I am more than happy to make it, just not here.
