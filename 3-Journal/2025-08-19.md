## Classes 

### US History 
We had an activity about learning vocab. This was by creating several things, like comics, playing cards, or in my case, doing a short story. It was hard to fit those into three sentences, but I was able to do it. 
### Honors Accelerated Pre-Calc 
We learned about [[Concavity]]. We went through lesson 1.2 and 1.3 which I was able to finish with time left, so I worked on debate. Speaking of which I was able to give him the form. 
### Astronomy 
We did some basic things like how the Earth moves. It is nothing I need to take notes for, though I should start writing notes on astronomy as there is a lot to write.
