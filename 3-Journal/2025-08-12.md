# 2025-08-12

School is starting tomorrow. I had dnd today, the cheesed the boss. I feel annoyed by it, a bit sad too. But that is alright, I know what to do in the future to fix it. Having one or two things wrong can be fixed, especially with the next one. I still need to write the stuff for my book, but that can wait. My entire schedule has finally be fixed. I am pretty excited for it. I did not do anything today, but that is ok. I will focus on things that happen in school to keep me on track. I will try to sleep early today, comparatively, so that I have energy for tomorrow. Now that I have stuff to do, I am getting more energy. I also feel myself becoming more disorganized, but who cares, I can fix it when the day comes. I really cannot think of anything else to write, but I am afraid that I will lose the habit if I do not keep going. I am just happy man. It has been a while since I felt this way. Mostly it is random spirts of happiness interlaced with other emotions, but I just feel happy now.
