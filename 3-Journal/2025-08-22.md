# 2025-08-22

I am writing this pretty late. I did not do session planning today, it is the one thing I did not do. Though I have some good ideas. I think tomorrow I will have to finish the session planning, research the colleges, and cut some Aff cards. I know that I said I will test out Linux, but unless I am about to do all three of those things in a single pomodoro session, I do not think I will do that. Yeah I tested out the Pomodoro method, I should probably make a note on it, but it is going pretty well. Well it did for the things I wanted to do. The thing I did not, plan the session, I did not get started on it. I think I will just relax tomorrow and do those three things. All the others can wait for later. My dad came back today which was nice, I thought he would have been there for a full day.
