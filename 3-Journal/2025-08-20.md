I did not do all that I wanted to do today. That is ok, but I should do better. Yes, technically I was only one away from completing all of my goals, but after talking to my friends the entire time, I was not able to get even close to finishing the session planning. The lock in effect seems to be fading, or it just did not work for dnd planning. I think I should have breaks in between drastically different things. I cannot do debate in the same wavelength as school or dnd stuff and vice versa. I think I should be going to sleep a bit earlier, for the sake of myself. I really want to keep making those characters, I think the only way I can make better characters is making characters over and over again. I should watch a video about making characters and write my own notes. I did a mini-essay after a while today, I think I can get used to doing those; it was pretty fun to write. I realize that there are a lot of things within the Rough folder that I have to do, but I just do not feel like doing them any time soon. I am already swamped with all of the activities I do, I think those should be started when I have free time.
