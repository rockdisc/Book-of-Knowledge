I had the session today, people were bored during it. I was not able to get everything I wanted to do out of it. That is fine because I learned from it. I think I should stop being so angry. I did not do much else today, I customized a new app that I realized I did not want to use. I think having the next session be more exciting would be good, for both groups.
