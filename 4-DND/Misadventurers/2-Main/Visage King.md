Formed from the dreams of the dead going to eat the [[Celestial Realm]] but is being stopped by the [[Monarch's Forest]] [[Death Coven]] 

*The Visage King, with eyes aglow,
Started eating dreams, as all should know.
With hunger vast and endless might,
He devoured visions deep in night.*

*He tore through Earth, his tail does thrash,
A quiet, twisting, silent flash.
The skies did darken, the seas did churn,
As the King of Visage began to burn.*

*To ash he turned, his form afire,  
But not from flame, from dark desire.  
He burned beneath the twisted crag—  
Roots clutching rot, the Galthias snag.  
Its blood-red sap, he drank it whole,  
He killed the tree with hag-made soul.*

*Now to the Ethereal, claws extended,
In search of souls, their light to bend.
With every tear, with every scratch,
He claims what’s fading—no soul to match.*

*Soon, the Celestial, a meal untold,
The King’s dark hunger, ruthless, bold.
And all that’s left, in every plane,
Is the shadow of his endless reign.*

**But etched in verse, this warning clings—  
A cage of rhyme that binds the King.  
So long these words are read, recite,  
He cannot claim the final light.**
