# Summary

They start this session off where they ended last time, right after meeting the Bag Man.
They remember hearing some parts of the poem:
Their first sleep, they heard:

	The Visage King, with eyes aglow,
	Started eating dreams, as all should know.
	With hunger vast and endless might,
	He devoured visions deep in night.

The next times they slept, they heard:

	Now to the Ethereal, claws extended,
	In search of souls, their light to bend.
	With every tear, with every scratch,
	He claims what’s fading—no soul to match.


Last, they heard the swinging pile of flesh sing 2 things, at start it sang:

	Soon, the Celestial, a meal untold,
	The King’s dark hunger, ruthless, bold.
	And all that’s left, in every plane,
	Is the shadow of his endless reign.

When they attacked it, it sang:

	He tore through Earth, his tail does thrash,
	A quiet, twisting, silent flash.
	The skies did darken, the seas did churn,
	As the King of Visage began to burn.

They are right now near the Mountain.
They remember the advice of Book, who cannot walk, Trap, the lanky man, and Fold, who may have been crazy, but was the most useful. 
**They see a lot of things are decaying**

## Going to the City

They walk to see that one of the trial markers is wrong. If they investigate further they can find that it is a tree that should be norther up with the rest. If they ever turn away from it, it will disappear. If they climb up it, they will see stone. 

As they continue walking, Book(Actually Gris) will ask them one by one which god they worship. If they do not stop her, it will go to Kowshik last and start prodding at him, asking more personal questions about his past.

> Do you remember your mother, the one that gave birth to you?
> Do you remember your second?

If he answers no, it will attack him, if he says yes, it will continue to prob him.

If they are to damage it, they see that no blood comes out, but it crumbles into a pile of skin, that of Book's. On the inside of it is carved over and over again, the symbols on Kowshik's dagger.

They start to see the stars, as the Visage is approaching them, much faster than they have seen it before. 

==First hint of them weakening its chains==

## Remains of [[Narras Kingdom]]

They are just able to reach the city by day break. As they set up camp to sleep, they hear the same whispers. People standing on guard can hear noises of gurgling and excited yelps and some barks coming from deeper in the city. An even higher roll can reveal that they hear singing from the other side of the city, where the castle should have been.
**Pick someone to wake up in the middle of the night to see a moving castle in the sky**

Walking through the city, some of the buildings have symbols on them, the bigger ones, probably that of the nobles had symbols of a tree with no leaves. Garry says that his nation was founded in front of an immortal tree which helped fertilize the land (with the blood of its victims). If they walk toward the town first, they will see a group of ogres big and small trying to make a life here. They can do whatever they want. They seem to be eating decaying food, some of them are actually decaying. Those ones are staying away from the children.

#### [[Garry Narras]]'s inheritance 

Going toward the castle, Garry remembers that it was near a tree near where he and his mother used to talk. Going there now, they see a crater where the castle used to be. On the very edge of it, is a decaying tree that has a man with no skin hanging on it. Getting closer they see that it is lanky, yet its arms and legs seem to be folding in on itself. It is singing, in the hoarse voice of Trap:

	To ash he turned, his form afire,  
	But not from flame, from dark desire.  
	He burned beneath the twisted crag—  
	Roots clutching rot, the Galthias snag.  
	Its blood-red sap, he drank it whole,  
	He killed the tree with hag-made soul.

If they attack it, it will stop singing and say this before it turns into a puddle.

> [!quote] 
> Come back to us Silence, come back to your mother's imbrace

The ground near it seems to be dug up, leaving only a very old note. It is from Garry's mother apologizing. 

Dear Son, 

I apologize for such a hasty letter, but I do not have the time. Our kingdom has fallen, It is because of SYMBOLS. I remember promising you an inheritance, yet most of it has gone to saving the people. For this I again apologize, this is all that is left. 
I have also left you the last remains of our strength, the Centurion.
Sincerely, Your Mother

## The [[Townwalker]] 

I honestly don't know what to do if they have not figured out it was a Townwalker by now.

On their way to where they saw the townwalker last. They see Gris piloting the body of Trap. She does that enemy of my enemy speech and tries to get them on her side. In the end she says that they will find her and Noir in their fight with the townwalker, she hopes they will not be enemies. **She will give them the bow as a sign of trust.**

**The Lost Prince has Claimed his Arc**

They will hear singing coming from a direction very far away. This is Fold, they will reach him with most of his muscles still recognizable. He sings:

	But etched in verse, this warning clings—  
	A cage of rhyme that binds the King.  
	So long these words are read, recite,  
	He cannot claim the final light.

The townwalker will start to have stones around its legs

They find the town walker, whichever way they enter, if its through the underground, they well come across puddles of rot they have to avoid.

If they come in from above, they will have to deal with both the copies of Gris who move awkwardly and the stiffly moving stone people. 

#### The Galthias Tree 

All throughout the, either underground or castle, there are murals of people praying to the tree and it giving life to a town. 

At the center of the castle, in its throne room, they see the man with the head of the [[Giant King]] but has the body of an old woman. He has the weapon that makes shockwaves.

If they did not agree to Gris, they will have neutral combat during it as both Gris and Noir will not stop attacking them if that means getting more hits on the giant. 

**The Giant slayer has claimed his prey**

They will have to go against the 2 to kill the townwalker, during this entire time Gris has been wearing the body of Fold. Kowshik will unlock his power of negation. 

**The Angel of Silence has regained his wings**

## Aftermath

If they stopped the [[Death Coven]], [[Unforgiving Death]] will be lessened, if not, she will be strengthened and the king will not seem to be happy. 

Improv the rest.
