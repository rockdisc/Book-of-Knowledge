#Session/Misadventurers

Right after coming back from the last quest, and collecting their reward the guild master Tobias tells them that Bici is being invaded by the Chuul again. The last time this happened was 20 years ago.

Home town of [[Heim]]

They have a day to do whatever they want before they go.

On the ship over to Bici

Poor- Meet a member of the cult of the 5 heads

- The [[Lord of 5 Faces]] and the cult of the heads think that it is attacks from Tiamat for the people closest to the heavens(Aasimar) not to be connected to her, but instead Kuyutha and "Worship" Umberlee(the Bitch of the Sea) (It is Tiamat but she is doing it to get enough sacrifices to get herself resurrected)

Modest- Meet the scarred hunter

Rich- A group of chatty noble hunters

- The Nobles think of this as a seasonal hunt now and are trying to go hunting, the noble district has grown a lot from 20 years ago due to some signs the monsters left of coming back.(The signs they left were because Tiamat was not summoned)

The ship stops them a bit before Bici in a temorary settlement

- Some of the people at the settlement think that it is an invasion from Seglis(DC 10 history check to realize that that is not the case)

While they are there they see a person preaching to a crowd of people that all holding an amulet with 5 faces. Saying something in a 1 2& 3 beat

The man is wearing a metal helmet that covers his entire face with 5 faces on it. He is talking about being good people. Staying there for the night, they see the people giving out dinner.

The next day they go to the town for Milan to see that it is very different, he recognizes almost nothing, meet the girl from Milan's home town again and other people also start to recognize him, they are excited to see him and are sorry at the same time.

Players see the young mayor only around 13 as he tells them to go to the red church to get detail on what to do.

He goes with them
