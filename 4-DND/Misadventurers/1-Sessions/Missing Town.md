#Session/Misadventurers 

The town of Tern is not trading goods, it is as through it disappeared. There is a guild quest for C rank adventurers to figure out what is happening.

Town is a [[Townwalker]]

Players will take a ship to Papon then a Carriage the rest of the way.

Papon does not have much lumber or magic items due to the trade routes being cut off

After they enter Elman, they will see 2 weird people, these guys are too far away to be walking distance from any town. They hold sticks straight up and stand perfectly still until the players get within 60 ft(look at characters)

After combat the sticks turn back into stone

Players continue on until they see a town slightly smaller than Papon that is in the middle of nowhere

When they enter they see their stone stick turns to wood again

They enter and see everyone there is kinda off when they ask about Tern they act like they do not hear

They stay the night because it is late. Either after a drink or when they wake up late at night one of them see the tower clock is an eye and people are frozen and stone

In the morning they have to do small tasks in the town due to the closed gate not working. Every time they do a task, they explore and realize that all of it is not normal.

The town is small with walls all around it with a tower that is a lot fancier than the other buildings with a clock on it

Same a cat from a tree, the cat is too heavy, the tree is pulsing. The woman yells as a whisper sound

Find a missing chicken, In a blood filled hole and hops out

Help an old man clean the tower, Shit does down

As they climb up they realize it is the mouth of the beast, they either fight of escape

They are chased until they escape using their magic flight card![[MissingTown.png]]
