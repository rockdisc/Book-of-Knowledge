#Worldbuilding/Story 
## Worldbuilding

When creating a map, make it country-sized and make the country pretty flat, the giant town monster can’t settle in on the uneven ground, so adding forests would make it better/ give cover to the monster.
The town the players start at would be a 2-day journey by land and cross one other town. You can pick the names but for this example, the missing town is Tern and the in-between town is Papon
Make the in-between town affected by the lack of trade 
Needed for worldbuilding:
4 towns:
1. the missing town
2. the town that the players start in
3. the town that is in between the two towns
4. town that is far away that sells magic items that got cut off from trade

## Character Creation

Play with either level 3 or 5 players, level 3 if there are more than 4 people. Any race or class is allowed, as long as it is high fantasy.
Players start with a group Bag of Holding, Decanter of Water, and each player can get a common/homebrew magic item of their choosing
They also get 1 small healing potion each
Backstory-wise, they are a group of adventurers in need of money, so they take the first quest they find on the board.


# Story

### Start

The characters look at the quest they just accepted(If you want to make a prop for this by writing on paper, you can) It says to travel to the missing town of Tern and figure out what happened, a bonus if it is located. Extra info to include is directions:
1. Find a way to the town of Papon and ask around about what happened (DM Note: this journey can happen on a boat, but the rest cannot)
2. Make a theory WITH PROOF of what happened to the town
3. Make your way back to collect the reward

You can also add extra info:
The town has not been trading for the past 2 weeks, the merchants that try to get there either return saying the town is not where it should be or do not come back at all.

### Journey to the First Town

No matter if they travel on a carriage or ferry/boat, have someone talk about diminishing magic item trade. The driver if they are taking a carriage, or other passengers if they are taking a boat. They can say things like:
“Trade has been hard without my bag of holding, I have to go back into the dark ages with take a carriage filled with luggage everywhere”
“The town of (Insert magic town name) is where I am from but I can’t get back there in a reasonable time for winter’s eve because the town up and decided to disappear”
“Load of horse shit I think! How can a town just vanish, some man probably wanted to, make some good profit”
These are just a few examples, I recommend you change them to fit your players.

### First Town

As they enter the town, they realize that there is no market, even though it's a Sunday when everyone will be hustling and it is the day for outdoor markets. It is gloomy and the middle of the town feels like the outskirts, barely any talking, and just seems dead, at past noon when everyone should be out. The only people unaffected are the children who are playing on a tree. If they talk to anyone, they say it is because no one wants to sell without magic fridges and other magic items that improve everything. They need to be calibrated every month, and the town disappeared when that calibration needed to happen, now it's been two weeks of this and they have not adapted to the lifestyle change yet. Also, the fact that some of them see an eye when they are sleeping, looking at them in their dreams. The town points them in the direction of the missing town. They can sleep in a tavern in this town. If that happens roll a d4 for the number of players you have. If any of them get one, they see a giant reddened eye with technicolor pupils looking back at them.

If they came here in a boat, they need to convince a carriage that is willing to take them on a mission that could end in death, judging that this may not happen, I will not elaborate on this, you can make a plot event yourself, or just make them roll persuasion

### Journey to the Missing Town

After they enter the forest, they see 2 weird people, these guys are too far away to be within walking distance from any town. They hold sticks straight up and stand perfectly still until the players get within 60 feet (look at characters)
They make mistakes in their speech and seemingly contradict themselves. Make it noticeable but not apparent. They say that the town of Tern never existed but then say that they are from a nearby town of Kerm which changed its name from Tern.
They can do things like switch up their names, put the verbs at the end of the sentence, etc.


If the players find a contradiction or try to continue past them, they fight. They fight like robots and can tank a lot of hits 
Their blood flows like water and not like blood

After combat the sticks turn into stone

![[MissingTown.png]]

In the morning they have to do small tasks in the town due to the closed gate not working. The gate stopped working after letting them in for some reason, they cannot fix it. Every time they do a task, they explore and realize that all of it is not normal. (you can go in any order)
 
- The woman yells at a whisper sound to get the party’s attention to help her with the cat. Get the cat from a tree, the cat is much heavier than it should be, and the tree is pulsing, like the pulse in your wrist.
 
- A boy lost his chicken, they look around, DC 20 nature check. They find the chicken in a pit filled with blood about 100 feet deep, an open-ended puzzle of how to get the chicken out.
 
- There is an old man near the central tower cleaning it, he will ask them to go inside with him to clean it. “It's been a long time since I’ve been in there, my old bones cannot reach the top.” When they go inside make them roll a wisdom saving throw, this is to see if they are enthralled by the eye of the tower DC 20 if they fail it says that they feel off but they really want to explore the tower. Success will lead to them thinking that something is off in the tower. They start climbing up the spiral staircase, with dirty walls on both sides it is only big enough to fit one person width-wise. They keep going up, it seems to extend forever, if they ask, the man says it is a 10-minute walk up, the higher they go, the more the smell of iron. If they very try to go down, the old man, who is walking behind them convinces them not to by saying things like: 
“Sorry would you please do this for me”
“It's just a little further”
“It won’t hurt you in the slightest”
Anything to make sure the players do not go back down
When they reach the top they see a door, the old man puts his arms out to stop them from going, he is like a boulder and cannot be moved he says “Once you enter the maw of the beast, you cannot get out” They must open the door.

### Boss

They open the door to find the entire room filled with flesh and see the back of a giant eyeball. It turns to look at them as they see a technicolor eye. It has 4 flesh tentacles going to different parts of the arena.
If the players cut one of the tendrils, body parts of people made of mud come out, hands or legs that try to inhibit movement. After cutting the tendrils the eye will take more damage, and the tendrils spew water and mud. If the players cut all of the tendrils, the eye will die, or they can just attack the eye head-on
I am not making a stat block for the boss, kill it when the attack is cool enough, and let it last a few turns though. The AC is 20 because it is slippery.

### The Escape

After the eyeball dies, all of the town’s people notice and start walking to the tower, with an open-ended question of how they get out. After they get out, a giant crab leg comes out of the ground and lifts the town up out of the ground as it starts walking in a random direction d4, on a 1 it starts walking in the direction of the players and walks over them. End it off by saying: “You blinded it, but was that enough"
