# Summary

They start meeting with [[Thrainn Dval]] as he tells them their quest:

1. Gain control of [[Kyling]] by talks before he dies 
	1. Along the way find and collect [[Users]] to fight for the army. You can do this by giving them a piece of paper which lets us take control of them only if they are willing. They can become willing by force. 
	2. In [[Glasir]] they will find [[Lain]] the previous commander, convince him to come back and take the place of Thrainn 
2. Go through the South and incapacitate all of the main fighters of the [[Orsian Military Structure]]
3. Deal with the [[Elvagars]]
4. End the war 

He gives them the [[Syncing Tablet]] 
![[Syncing Tablet]]

He explains to them what an [[Artifact]] is. 
He tells them that there is a special person within each city. Beware the one in Aarhus as he will become a [[Arouran Military Structure|horn]] in the future. 
This is the perfect time to start as the slave traders are bringing in some slaves to the cities nearby. They will be in Arklow at that time. Both a slave and a captor will be strong users that the army can use. 

The slave trade is bad, but not when it is to our benefit. 
He warns them to not use [[Pusher]]s even when their enemies use them as they seem to have severe drawbacks, only use them when absolutely necessary. 

The previous Tail has not been doing its job, so when you see them, tell them that they are no longer employed, We will spread the word, but they are not the type to listen to such things. 

He says to be careful in the last snowfall, around when they reach Narf 

Just go to the military camp to get your supplies 

## Within City 

The belief in [[Abaddon]] is now out lawed. People across the city are going into [[Shade]] withdrawal, some people come up to the part asking if they have shade on them. 
On their way they see several Abaddon believers getting chained and whipped. People are talking about wanting the slave caravan to arrive sooner 

The Church gives them a week's worth of food and camping supplies along with a carriage and 2 horses at the military camp 


### Outside City

The moment they get out of the city, they see each other turn to them and ask:

> [!quote] 
> Why do you keep playing in his hand?

This is [[Vargris]] the Fool. He asks them why it said to end the war, not win it. Question him omnipotence. He is just playing god, do not believe in what he says. He is as big a fool as me.


## Going to Arklow 

Day 1:

They see a trader caravan on their way going to Torg, she, [[Vextra the Trader]], an explorer that you remember hearing tavern tales about, asks of they want to buy anything, a discount on a few things she does not want to carry with her. 

A gem of single cast revivify which a person can use to cast revivify 1 time. 250 each, has 3

5 potions of healing (2d4) for 30 each

1 spell scroll(one time use) for any spell up to 5th level, aside from revivify, for cantrip 10, 1-50, 2-100, 3-150, 4-200, 5-250

She has spiritual power coming from her, though they cannot identify what power it is.
She says its the second time this week that a party tried to recruit her into the army 
==She can teleport anything she wants near her, has to include herself, anywhere she has been.==



They notice a poorly made trap in the road, it is a clump of snow and dirt that is not melting along with the rest. It is a pitfall, there is about 5 people with knives and bows in the forest on each side trying to rob them. They are Abaddon believers that are trying to escape slavery, they were just going to take their food. 


They see a man walking from the river and hails them. He, Esqine Augean, askes if they can give him a ride to Meod, he is willing to pay them in [[Artifact]]s. He starts to ask them all sorts of questions about the nation and is very bad at hiding that he is an elvagar. If they transport him all the way, he will give them the ![[Blinding Gluttony]]
He tells them about the [[Augurs]], specifically about the night of 7 artifacts when the Sovereign was made. 

The night at the camp they see a flock of birds settle down where they set up camp. 


Day 2:

An early slave caravan is going through to get ahead of the bigger one askes if they would like some slaves for their trip.

There is a small carriage being pulled by 5 horses, which Esqine seems interested in, he says that it is an artifact. The shopkeeper says that he is a traveling artifact seller. If they accept to go in, they will see a lot of items but he tells them that there are only 3 the catch his eye. 
![[Dream Veil]]
200 g

![[Puppet's String]]
300 g

![[Muse's Mask]]
300 g

Esqine does not like the scammers that try to sell off fake artifacts. 

A flock of sparrow start following them. It seems like an ability. 

They arrive in town by nightfall

## In Arklow 

A tavern costs 1 gold each, price has increased now that the caravan in here, "you should have came in tomorrow if you wanted the regular price."

A male slave has the power of a flame knife, Bund has an ability called Burn Lucifer 

The head guard, a woman, Herta has Copy Janus which lets her copy an ability.

Figure it out from there.
