# Summary

They start walking into the office of [[Thrainn Dval]], who they had heard a lot about, but never have seen before. Well, someone with military background has been seen before. 

You are part of a mercenary guild, but the last few quests they gave there were a test. They were orchestrated by Thrainn to find the people who could complete his quest. 

As they open up the door, it takes a dc 10 strength check, a pile of papers gets shoved aside. There is so much loose paper that it seems the room is made of it. 

They see an older man with greying hair peek out from behind the biggest pile, he examines them for a bit, then busts out laughing. 2 more heads, from either side of the room now look outside their papers, on man, one woman, both younger. The girl starts to laugh while the guy is confused.
