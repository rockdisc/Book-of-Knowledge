# Summary

They start walking into the office of [[Thrainn Dval]], who they had heard a lot about, but never have seen before. Well, someone with military background has been seen before. 

You are part of a mercenary guild, but the last few quests they gave there were a test. They were orchestrated by Thrainn to find the people who could complete his quest. 

As they open up the door, it takes a dc 10 strength check, a pile of papers gets shoved aside. There is so much loose paper that it seems the room is made of it. 

They see an older man with greying hair peek out from behind the biggest pile, he examines them for a bit, then busts out laughing. 2 more heads, from either side of the room now look outside their papers, on man, one woman, both younger. The girl starts to laugh while the guy is confused. 

The girl is [[Serafin Fitz]], who can see the most likely future of anyone she sees.
The guy is [[Barlo Eden]], can analyze the things and learn more about them, just by hearing their name.

The 2 are laughing because they realized that the people that have the highest chance of winning the war are the same people that have the highest chance of destroying it. 

He explains to them their quest: 
1. Gain control of [[Kyling]] by talks before he dies 
	1. Along the way find and collect [[Users]] to fight for the army. You can do this by giving them a piece of paper which lets us take control of them only if they are willing. They can become willing by force. 
	2. In [[Glasir]] they will find [[Lain]] the previous commander, convince him to come back and take the place of Thrainn 
2. Await further instructions

They can ask him questions. 

He gives them the ![[Scribe's Accomplice]]

Thrainn has the [[King's Accomplice]], while they do not know who has the [[Jester's Accomplice]], they have never seen a message from it, though they can sense that someone owns it and the spirituality coming from the accomplices is a bit weird, nothing to worry about. As long as the person they want to send over signs the paper with their actually signature, they can be teleported over. 

Explain what an [[Artifact]] is to everyone if they do not already know. He tells them 2 quick things, 
1. do not use [[Pusher]]s
2. He tells them they are going to be called the Tail, there used to be a previous tail, but they are no longer in the army. Asks if they have any more questions before sending them off:

He wishes that [[Boreal]] keep them safe. TAP YOUR SHOLDERS WITH YOUR HAND. 

## Travel 


### Within City:

1. A guy runs up to them, a half-orc, beaten and disheveled. He seems to be sniffing the air and asks them if they can give him some [[Shade]]. He will first give them a sob story of being about to die, they try to give them a silver coin, finally he will try to attack them, though he is very easy to defeat.
2. The moment they get outside the Castletown they here something being written on the Scribe, It is the Fool, [[Vargris]], who asks them why they plan in his palm? They see the different handwriting. He pretends to be a person that got kicked out of the nation because he went against the will of Thrainn, what is more of a dictatorship, the South or the North?
3. As they pass next to a church of [[Abaddon]], they see people throwing stones up into the air next to it as they pass. They remember, specifically Aryan who is a missionary, that [[Boreal]] believers used to throw pieces of food there, if it landed on the church it would be good luck. It was a changed symbol of the fight between [[Abaddon]] and [[Boreal]], but now it has become degrading. A few kids come by with a large bag, it is filled with bones. They ask the party if they want to throw them at the church. The bones are of the people who died by the hands of the church, they would have wanted to get their deaths avenged, or so they say. 

### Day 1:

1. They meet [[Vextra the Trader]]
They see a trader caravan on their way going to Torg, she, [[Vextra the Trader]], an explorer that you remember hearing tavern tales about, asks of they want to buy anything, a discount on a few things she does not want to carry with her. 

A gem of single cast revivify which a person can use to cast revivify 1 time. 250 each, has 3

5 potions of healing (2d4) for 30 each

1 spell scroll(one time use) for any spell up to 5th level, aside from revivify, for cantrip 10, 1-50, 2-100, 3-150, 4-200, 5-250

She has spiritual power coming from her, though they cannot identify what power it is.
She says its the second time this week that a party tried to recruit her into the army 
==She can teleport anything she wants near her, has to include herself, anywhere she has been.==
