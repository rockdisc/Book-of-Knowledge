# Summary


## Nain to forest 


After sending [[Bardi]] to [[Torg]], They are told to continue on to [[Hoste]]. 

The people of Nain seem to be confused as they heard several explosions coming from the castle, they can choose to explain or not. 

It is a 2 day journey to Erna. In the middle they will find a very small town of Tors, it is so small its not even on most maps.

**Day 1:**

They see bandits attacking a carriage, shifting through it to see if it has any goods. There are 5 of them, all have [[Shrouding Ring]]s. 2 of them special abilities, one of them has a [[Trow]] and the other has an [[Artifact]]. The Trow can turn themself into a wolf, ==howl Ulfr==. The artifact is:

![[Chain of Unfortunate Events]]

Out of session explain what an artifact is as [[Michael Leech]], [[Curze]], and [[Adamzka]] already know. [[Derick]] seems to be drawn in by it. 

The traders thank them and go on their way, saying it is the second time they got stolen from in such a short trip. The first was by Tors. 


Past lunch they find a caravan transporting items to [[Torg]]. They ask if they want anything, the trader notices that they are all [[Users]] because of his monocle, an artifact: 

![[Crystal Lens]]
 He says he is willing to sell it for cheap if they buy something else. 

If they ask, he is trying to get rid of a lot of his stalk because of all of the thieves in these roads. He already got stolen from near Tors. He says that he was lucky that person was stupid, he only took a useless [[Artifact]]:

![[Silent Viel]]
He asks them to look around the shop. They only find 3 that catch their eye(I am not making more):

![[Master Key]]
1000 g
![[Awfully Cumbersome]]
750 g
![[Reminisce]]
2000 g

He shows them a pair of invisible trousers called the Emperor's New Clothes saying that they can only be seen by the righteous, but that is actually true. [[Bobby]] notices something off about the trousers, if he puts them near his deck of cards, they turn into the Emperor card. He askes for 500 g to buy it. 

Derick is having a field day in here, it seems he has a sort of connection to these items, though he cannot place it. He is just happy to see all of them. 

He has an item that teleports people outside of his carriage and stuns them for half a day. 

## In the small town of Tors 

They reach here by nightfall. It is very small and rural, mostly covered in farmlands near the river and forests to all the other directions. There is a nice inn where a lot of the villagers are drinking and dancing. A cheap night, 1 silver for all 6 of the guys. At night Derick sees something in the distance and askes them to go with him. On top of a nearby hill there is a [[Trow]] sitting by himself. Derick realizes that it is his [[Spirits]]. He absorbs it, but does not know what it does. They can try and figure it out. He has 1 turn of it to start. 

==To absorb it, he must entertain it/make it bond with him in some way==

[[Derick]] has the power to maintain the affect of any [[Artifact]] he examines. Though he also has the downsides. His full, there are no downsides. As he examined the [[Chain of Unfortunate Events]], [[Crystal Lens]], [[Silent Viel]], and [[Reminisce]]. All of the effects apply to him in semi. Which means he has disadvantage, headaches, cannot speak, and hears voices, but is able to easily examine artifacts, and cut into memories. He has not yet learned to disable his power. His power is called ==Steal Amon==. 

In the morning, if they talk to the villagers, they say that they have heard people are getting stolen from, but not from there village so most of them pay it no mind thinking it is just some lucky kid that found some weapon or his spirit and is testing it out. Another says to talk to old lady Gertrude because her grandson was missing for a bit. She is by the tree near the center of the village. She tells them that he said he heard sounds from the forest and left. 2 days later she got a letter from him saying he found his spirit and is going to follow 


## Fight with [[Nibkil]] 

%%Artifact gives power to word spoken for as long as you do not speak, flaw is you cannot speak. Another he has makes him observe every change in his surrounds to the point he takes damage drawback of for the next ten minutes after taking it off he has to say all of the onomatopoeia he hears. %%
