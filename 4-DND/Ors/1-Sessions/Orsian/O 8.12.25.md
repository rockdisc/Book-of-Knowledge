# Summary


## Nain to forest 

%%Explain [[Artifact]]s by seeing a trader, does the Emporer's new clothes, but they are actually legit to trick them into buying a fake one
%%

After sending [[Bardi]] to [[Torg]], They are told to continue on to [[Hoste]]. 

The people of Nain seem to be confused as they heard several explosions coming from the castle, they can choose to explain or not. 

It is a 2 day journey to Erna. In the middle they will find a very small town of Tors, it is so small its not even on most maps.

**Day 1:**

They see bandits attacking a carriage, shifting through it to see if it has any goods. There are 5 of them, all have [[Shrouding Ring]]s. 2 of them special abilities, one of them has a [[Trow]] and the other has an [[Artifact]]. The Trow can turn themself into a wolf, ==howl Ulfr==. The artifact is:

![[Chain of Unfortunate Events]]

Out of session explain what an artifact is as [[Michael Leech]], [[Curze]], and [[Adamzka]] already know. [[Derick]] seems to be drawn in by it. 

The traders thank them and go on their way, saying it is the second time they got stolen from in such a short trip. The first was by Tors. 


Past lunch they find a caravan transporting items to [[Torg]]. They ask if they want anything, the trader notices that they are all [[Users]] because of his monocle, an artifact: 

![[Crystal Lens]]
 He says he is willing to sell it for cheap if they buy something else. 

If they ask, he is trying to get rid of a lot of his stalk because of all of the thieves in these roads. He already got stolen from near Tors. He says that he was lucky that person was stupid, he only took a useless [[Artifact]]:

![[Silent Viel]]
He asks them to look around the shop. They only find 3 that catch their eye(I am not making more):

![[Master Key]]
1000 g
![[]]
