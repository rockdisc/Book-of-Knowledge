They are the strongest of the [[Elvagars]] and live in [[Elvaghiem]]. They are the heads of their families and carry most of the [[Artifact]]s of the family. Every family have one but they are only called Lesser augurs. Above them are the 12 Labors which are families trailing back to the start of the elvagars. For one reason or another they do not have as much power as the 7 Virtues. They are all thought of as equal aside from the Sovereign [[Frale]]
