#Worldbuilding/Item #Ors/Artifact  

It is an [[Artifact]] which allows for one to write to each other over long distances. It can be communicated with by the [[King's Accomplice]], which can transfer items in between, and the [[Jester's Accomplice]] which can transfer powers. 

## Drawback

When using it, the user is not able to observe or feel anything aside from the paper and the pen.
