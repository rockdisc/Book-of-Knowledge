#Worldbuilding/Character #Ors/NPC 

## Summary

He is related to the [[Hurricane]].

He stays in [[Dvalinn]] where he knows he will die. When the Orsian party meets him, he will say everything that will happen in the future. He will say that he will die from one of their blades, and that whichever side kills him is the one that will lose the war. He was actually lying, it is whoever kills him will win, but he was still going to die by their weapon, so he makes a plan to use their own weapon to kill him.

He plays with them and tricks them into trying to get someone on their side to kill him as that will make it so that they will face the Fool, [[Vargris]]
