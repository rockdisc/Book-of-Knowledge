One of the [[Myths of Ors]]
_Arourans believe in Volva’s Prophecy; Orsians believe in Sibyl’s Prophecy_

Spoken by Sibyl/Volva the prophet

Let me tell you, children of the Cadaver God of the beginning, from the original nothing to the continued beings, and the feelings of the original creation.

In the beginning, there was [[Ginnungagap]]—an empty sea both hot and cold, yet neither hot nor cold. Then came a scream, a scream that came from Ginnungagap: “Too Cold!” it cried. Almost in response, the emptiness collapsed on itself. It came so close together that it began heating up. How long this took does not matter, for time did not yet exist. “Too Hot!” screamed Ginnungagap, the Ymir, as it stretched out again, making the once-hot sea cold. This caused the sea—Ginnungagap itself—to start steaming until something came from the nothing: the first object, the death of nothing—a cloud, [[Urania]].

Urania began to take shapes, hundreds of times over, with thousands of different forms. Ymir kept watching, forever curious, until they decided they wanted to make some of those things. But there was nothing except the cloud and Ymir themself. They were mesmerized by the cloud and did not want to destroy their muse, so they began to rip out and mold pieces of themself. These pieces formed the world: their liquid body became the land, with its shifting waves becoming mountains and hills. It built and built until all that remained were its “hands,” which were bleeding. Oh, it bled and it bled. With every piece torn from itself, the pain deepened—but Urania kept changing into more and more shapes, so many that the Creator’s Hands could not keep up.

The hands then decided to make their last creation: beings that could mirror the creativity of Urania and the intelligence of Ymir. These thinking beings, molded from the right hand of Ymir, are as follows:

- The thumb, thick and strong — the dwarves.
    
- The index finger, maneuverable and dexterous — the humans.
    
- The middle finger, lanky and wise — the elves, oldest of the bunch.
    
- The ring finger, bonded for life and fiery — the dragonborn.
    
- And last but not least, the little finger, nimble and lucky — the halflings.
    

**[Species not mentioned are not considered sentient.]**

While the right hand made these, the left hand rose to the cloud, caressing her. Slowly, it fused with the cloud, transferring Ymir’s soul to her. As they fused, they became the original [[Spirits]], or [[Archspirits]]:

- The thumb became [[Abaddon]] the 12-Armed, stubborn, unchanging, Progenitor of the [[Trow]].
    
- The index finger became [[Cor]] the Authority, commanding and adaptable, Monarch of the [[Nixie]]s.
    
- The middle finger became [[Boreal]] the Pandemonium, anarchic and draconic, Wrath of the [[Sylph]].
    
- The ring and little fingers were the last to go, not wanting to part. They became like twins in every human being—even in you, my children. Look and see: one cannot be lifted without the other.
    
- The ring finger became the Crying Queen, [[Melpomene]], who took all the sorrow within Urania. She cried with sorrow and guilt, saying, “You should not have martyred yourself for me!” This is the origin of the tradition of placing a ring on your partner’s left ring finger—to say that even after death, you will not leave your beloved.
    
- Her twin, the little finger, was not the same. Though she laughed—oh, how she laughed!—a laugh of pure joy, for she, the Laughing Queen, [[4-DND/Ors/2-Main/Thalia]], took all the glee from Urania. Their tears painted the sky as stars.
    

But it was not only Urania that gained a soul. Everything originally made of Ymir did, over time. The land slowly shifts over eons. Yes, every mountain and pebble has a soul just like you. Be careful of what you say around them—a mountain does not only seek revenge once.

Even the blood of Ymir had a soul, though it was mad—creation itself and the beings upon it. It flooded the world, gathering followers who do not belong to the originals. The original people, the sprites, and Urania are the beginning of the sea’s hatred—for it was they who caused the death of its body. Now, it seeks entry into Örs for revenge.

The lands watched the sentients wander, aimless. This was a time before death or hunger or food—only land and sea. The gods, feeling pity, made things to help humanity (that is, all sentient races). From this came plants, animals, and most powerful of all—ideas. The people began worshiping these gods. Surprisingly, the gods grew stronger and gained dominion over what they had given to the people. Thus, the societies of both humans and gods began at the same time. Several gods earned positions in their hierarchy—this continues even today. Here is where our tales begin.

But wait! Before we begin, you must know of two things—two things that changed the world forever: Death and Spirits.

From this point on, the prophecies of Sibyl and Volva diverge.



**Volva:**

The people spread and spread until they covered the entire world, as their societies commanded all the land. Then they ran into a problem: there was no more land to conquer. So they started fighting — what else would they do? As the people fought, so did the gods, but there was no end to it. They would fight by day, rest at night, and then start fighting again.

While all of them were fighting, another god was growing stronger: the god of war became the strongest of all the gods as he went pillaging the homes of the other gods. He did this for several years as the wars continued. It got to a point where the gods would not even mention his name, and they still do not. We just call him the Original War. Finally, the gods decided to do something about it, since even humanity was being affected by him — things like scorched earth tactics were created by the Original War’s influence.

The [[Original War]] spent the night with the goddess of farming. They all gathered together to kill the Original War in his sleep, though this was still a difficult task. After his death, the gods ran into a new problem: when his daughter, the goddess of Assassination, cut his throat, a dark pus came out. This pus formed into a black mass, the first death, a monstrous being that imitated the visage of Boreal. It was a winged beast with draconic features. The only thing that made it different from a regular dragon was its giant size and its five heads. From the moment of its birth came forth death — if anything was done for too long, or not enough, or at all to humanity, it seemed as if they would die.

This killed off the first societies, leaving only a few around the world who listened to the gods, including us.

As we, the Orsians (both groups at that time), formed, we listened to the Shepherd, god of goats, [[Egdir]], as he sent them down from the mountains to help us live. For him, we pray and dedicate our sacrifices. As we were the first peoples to rise from the ashes, the spirits started looking at us. The archspirits all decided to move to our land: Boreal in the northern mountains, where he can still see his breath as lights in the sky; Abaddon buried himself in the middle of the land, carving mountains around himself to hide; Kors lives in his palace in the middle of the sea; and the two sisters flew across the skies, directing their tears downward, causing rain.

Egdir saw these archspirits and their offspring moving in, but he was more focused on one of them — the Laughing Queen, Thalia. The way she moved through the air charmed the Shepherd, so he went to ask for her hand. Though she agreed, it came with a catch: “My sister and I are one. Taking my hand means you have to take hers as well,” said Thalia. The Shepherd agreed. From this marriage we get the bonds between humanity and the spirits. This marriage invited many gods to the land, some of whom decided to stay. From this point forward, any person born in Ors has a bonded spirit with them. It is our duty to go find them, as we are stronger together.

**Sibyl:**

As the people spread across the land, the gods were communing above. They saw the spread of humanity and began making decisions about rule to keep conflict at bay. These debates were governed by the god of peace, though we have now forgotten his name. The discussions went pleasantly for hundreds of years—until hate began to brew among the gods of malice, lust, crime, and most importantly, the opposite of peace: war.

Because of this, they started plotting to end peace in the material world, as they drew their power from the prayers and respect—or contempt—of humanity. To do this, they realized they had to get rid of the god of peace, for as long as he monitored the discussions, nothing would change. So the smaller gods began creating cults and warmongering nations, while the sneakier ones assassinated the god of peace. From his death came a dark pus that formed into a black mass—the first death—a monstrous being that imitated the visage of Boreal. It was a winged beast with draconic features. The only difference between it and a regular dragon was its giant size and five heads. From the moment of its birth came forth death itself. If anything was done for too long, or not enough, or at all to humanity, it seemed they would die.

This killed off the first societies, leaving only a few around the world who still listened to the gods, including us.

As the main perpetrator, and because the gods feared the power he would gain, they executed the god of war using all their combined power—though they could do nothing to stop the new beings who would take up his position.

We survived only because we listened to the Shepherd, god of sheep, Egdir, who told us to use this enclosed paradise for our protection—a place filled with spirits and one of the few in the world that does not touch the sea. These spirits included the five archspirits: Boreal in the northern mountains; Abaddon buried himself in the middle of the land; Kors lives in his palace in the middle of the sea; and the two sisters who fly across the skies, directing their tears downward to cause rain.

As Egdir settled with us, his eyes were fixed on the Laughing Queen, Thalia. The way she moved through the air charmed the Shepherd, so he went to ask for her hand. She replied, “Though I would like to accept, that would mean being away from my sister, which I cannot bring myself to do.”

Hearing this, Egdir searched high and low for a solution until he found a man meditating on a mountain. Approaching him disguised as a fellow hermit, Egdir told the man of his dilemma. The man—my grandfather—gave him a brilliant solution. Returning to Thalia, Egdir said, “Let you be a guardian for humanity, and your sister be the same for spirits. Once our marriage



proceeds, spirits and humans will be one, and you will be together.”

From this point forward, every person born in Ors has a bonded spirit. It is our duty to find them, for we are stronger as one.
