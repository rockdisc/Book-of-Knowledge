### Powers

He is a miracle child 

His [[Ikon]] ability is that of future sight, he can see movement 1 second ahead described as seeing translucent strings that show the movements of everyone around him. this is only to sight and if it on for too long he starts to get a headache. It needs to be in a state of musing to activate it. 


His [[Numen]] ability is that of understanding, giving him a much better memory and allowing him to enter a state of musing much faster than a regular person this is because he has a mental projection of a notebook he can write in to remember forever. 

Together at the start the could be considered a miracle Reader.

## Future 

Maybe in the future, he gains the ability to see people's experiences from different points in time. This way I can do more worldbuilding while also making Gyles privy to knowledge a regular person would not know.  This could be called vignettes, and he would get them of people that are about to die.
