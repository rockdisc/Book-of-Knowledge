#Rough #OneShot

You start at in a tavern. 

## Setting 
“A man dies twice, first when his body dies, and again when he is forgotten”

“But a god only dies once”

Gods can only die if they are forgotten by their worshippers, the less people that know them the less power they have

False hydras can make people forget things, if a false hydra eats a person praying to a god, it can make everyone in its song’s range forget about the god, in a big city this can greatly decrease a gods power even kill one

Seeing this, the gods realized that they can be used offensively by demons

Though this maybe called an overreaction the gods banish every building that has a false hydra in it

The gods found a devil placing a placing a false hydra seed in this tavern and instantly banished it, the devil thought of all the spells he had and realized that the only one that could get him out was dimensional door, which started this whole thing

People are stuck in tavern in the celestial sea

They get there by randomly opening a door

Make it scary
