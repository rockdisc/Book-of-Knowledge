#Writing/PoetsLand #Rough 

Thump! I woke up to my head hitting against something hard. Still dazed and confused from recent events, I opened my eyes to see the glass I bumped into. Behind it were trees and foliage passing by; a sound of turning wheels and galloping hooves echoed from below. The previous me would not have recognized this sound, but it was very familiar to me now. I saw a reflection of a tan, scrawny boy with messy, ashen, brown almost blonde hair with a barely visible jawline and a small nose. He, I, had striking, bright orange, eyes that would been mistaken for an owl's if not for them being much smaller. The rest of my body was hidden behind smelly, wet, and weathered rags that were once clothes, and a cloth blanket laid over me. It was surprisingly easy to get used to, from the memories of the body I could tell we were around the same age, 22, but one could not have guessed. My old body with its unkempt beard and potbelly seemed much older, but this one did not have a single beard hair, a bit of fat, or muscle. I would probably have to show id every time I had to go into a pub, but I guess it is not something I would have to worry at this time.
