#### Lesson: Sacrifice is not Valiant if Done with Greed 


I sank into the cooling bath. It was freezing but Mother told me that it would help with my skin. When she found me there was a coating of grime and soot on my body, but now it is almost as smooth as hers though mine is not as dark. It was not dark like the people in the village, instead it was a shade of midnight, like the sky fell and formed into a human. I think that is the case because when I asked she just chucked and said that was how she was born. She has a really nice laugh. It was nothing like my father, no, Mother told be not to call that man my father anymore. I grab the bar of soap and start cleaning. I wonder what story she will tell me today. The first night I was still scared of her, so she told me the story of the old lady and the jar of honey. The few nights after that she told me more stories like that of the bird and her mother and grandmother spider. Each of her stories were different from the others, and they were all from different part of the world. Some of them even came from the Southern Continent. 

After a few more minutes of soaking I get out of the wooden tub and start wiping down. Looking back it I see how big it was. That man was pretty big, because of that his bathing bucket was very big too. I heard from some of my old neighbors that it was supposed to be for both him and my old mother, but in even my oldest memory of him washing me and my siblings, he could barely fit in there with one of us. This bucket would have fit five of him, now it is all for me. Mother said that she prefers to take a pour-over shower, so she left it for me to use. It would probably be a tight fit for her anyway. 

I put on the tunic she set out for me, it is a pretty loose fit, but she says that it is supposed to fit me even after I am d



In a forest long ago there used to only be owls and crows which hunted the mice. The owls were always the smartest and quietest, they set traps and caught the rodents. The crows were cunning, they would wait for a fox or wolf to hunt a big beast then scavenge their prey, yet they still had a thirst for mice. For the crows, mice were the only thing they could not get, so they envied the owls for catching them so easily. The owls, ever wise, did not seem to mind as the gazes of the crows did not matter to their hunt. 
One day, a crow was out scavenging. This crow was not very good at it though, even though she had a nest waiting for it with an egg, she did not have a partner. She had to find food, and she had to do it fast. Yet it was not food that she found, in a small red juniper tree, nestled between its branches, sat an egg. This egg was not like her own, small and weak, this one was large and sturdy. Though she had not seen one before, she knew exactly what it was, an egg of an owl.
