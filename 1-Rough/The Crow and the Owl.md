#### Lesson: Sacrifice is not Valiant if Done with Greed 


I si



In a forest long ago there used to only be owls and crows which hunted the mice. The owls were always the smartest and quietest, they set traps and caught the rodents. The crows were cunning, they would wait for a fox or wolf to hunt a big beast then scavenge their prey, yet they still had a thirst for mice. For the crows, mice were the only thing they could not get, so they envied the owls for catching them so easily. The owls, ever wise, did not seem to mind as the gazes of the crows did not matter to their hunt. 
One day, a crow was out scavenging. This crow was not very good at it though, even though she had a nest waiting for it with an egg, she did not have a partner. She had to find food, and she had to do it fast. Yet it was not food that she found, in a small red juniper tree, nestled between its branches, sat an egg. This egg was not like her own, small and weak, this one was large and sturdy. Though she had not seen one before, she knew exactly what it was, an egg of an owl.
