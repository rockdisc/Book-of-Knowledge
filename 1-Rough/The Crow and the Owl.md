#### Lesson: Sacrifice is not Valiant if Done with Greed 


I sank into the cooling bath. It was freezing but Mother told me that it would help with my skin. When she found me there was a coating of grime and soot on my body, but now it is almost as smooth as hers though mine is not as dark. It was not dark like the people in the village, instead it was a shade of midnight, like the sky fell and formed into a human. I think that is the case because when I asked she just chucked and said that was how she was born. She has a really nice laugh. It was nothing like my father, no, Mother told be not to call that man my father anymore. I grab the bar of soap and start cleaning. I wonder what story she will tell me today. The first night I was still scared of her 



In a forest long ago there used to only be owls and crows which hunted the mice. The owls were always the smartest and quietest, they set traps and caught the rodents. The crows were cunning, they would wait for a fox or wolf to hunt a big beast then scavenge their prey, yet they still had a thirst for mice. For the crows, mice were the only thing they could not get, so they envied the owls for catching them so easily. The owls, ever wise, did not seem to mind as the gazes of the crows did not matter to their hunt. 
One day, a crow was out scavenging. This crow was not very good at it though, even though she had a nest waiting for it with an egg, she did not have a partner. She had to find food, and she had to do it fast. Yet it was not food that she found, in a small red juniper tree, nestled between its branches, sat an egg. This egg was not like her own, small and weak, this one was large and sturdy. Though she had not seen one before, she knew exactly what it was, an egg of an owl.
