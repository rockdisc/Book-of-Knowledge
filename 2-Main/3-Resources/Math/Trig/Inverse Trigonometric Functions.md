#Math/Trigonometry 

Inverse functions sequentially undo everything done to one variable, this can be done by hand by flipping the variables and solving for $x$. 

This would mean $y=\sin x$ would become $y=\sin^{-1} x$. So on and so forth. 

$\sin^{-1}$ is not $\frac{1}{\sin}$ but instead a way of getting a corresponding angle from a valid $\sin$ value. It is also called $\arcsin$.
