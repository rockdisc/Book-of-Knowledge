#Math/Trigonometry

Trig functions are periodic, like [[Wave Mechanics|waves]] they repeat. The period of these functions is $2\pi$ so $\sin x = \sin (x+2\pi)$ and all other [[Trigonometric Functions]]. 

## Domain and Range 

For $y= \sin \theta$, domain is all the inputs, all real numbers($\mathbb{R}$), and the range is the output which can only be $-1 \le y \le 1$. This is the same for $y=\cos \theta$ 

For $y=\tan \theta$ the range is $\mathbb{R}$, the domain would be all real numbers if not for when $\cos \theta = 0$ when it would be undefined. This is from [[Basic Trigonometric Identities]] ![[Basic Trigonometric Identities#^d8c891]]
So the domain is $\mathbb{R}$ except for $\frac{\pi}{2} \pm \pi n$. 

## Transformations 

$y=a \sin (bx + h) k$

a increases the amplitude. If it is negative it just reflects on the x axis, this means for any function the amplitude is the $|a|$.
b is a horizontal stretch, if it were $y=\sin 2x$, the period would only be $\pi$. 
h and k are shifts, h is reversed.

### Special  

$\tan x =  \frac{x\sin}{\cos x}$
It has vertical [[asymptote]]s whenever $\cos$ reaches 0.
![[tan Graph.png|400]] 
It has a period of $\pi$. $\cot$ is flipped. 

$\csc$ and $\sec$ are different as they have asymptotes when $\sin=0$.
