![[Unit Circle.png|750]]

It is a circle with the radius of 1 at the origin of the coordinate plane. 

Every point on this circle has $(x,y)=(\cos \theta , \sin \theta)$
You can do this manually by using [[Trigonometric Functions]]. 

The best way of memorizing these is that all of the $\sin$ values start a 0 and go up by $\frac{\sqrt{ 1 }}{2}$ every time, and the opposite for $\cos$.
