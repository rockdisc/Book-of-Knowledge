Religions are not stagnant, they change and morph throughout time. If I want to make the religions of [[Boreal]] and [[Religious Organizations]] of Poet's Land seem well made, I should follow these steps. 

## Syncretism 

There are beliefs taken from several religions taken at the same time. People can go from church on Sunday and consult an oracle Monday. Starts in one culture while used in another 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> This is mainly for Poet's Land, there should be people that believe in in-between religions or do several rituals, the protagonist can be one of these peoples as they know the truth about the gods. 


## Ritualization 

There should be rituals in daily life for religions. Think of [[Islam]] going to the [[Mecca]] or their daily prayers. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> For both, have rituals 


## Materiality 

Have materials and symbols from all religions.
> [!tip] Recommendation 
> What symbols do they have?

## Lived Religion 

What do people do so show their religion, every person is different but there could be recent trends. Some people might endorse these trends, others may not. The ruling classes can even make them beneficial to them. People can know that the things that they are doing do not mean anything, but will do it anyway in hopes they might. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> The higher ranking people in churches may feel this way.
