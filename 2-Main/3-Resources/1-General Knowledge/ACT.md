#School/StandardizedTesting 

American College Testing is a test that ranks up to 36 with anything in the high 20s being considered good, while most ivy league colleges look for a score in the 30s. When I first took it there were 4 mandatory sections: English, Reading, Math, and Science. There is also a Writing section which, unless you are going into an ELA field, there is no reason to do. Now there is only 3 sections with Science being optional, though I will still take it as I am going into a science field.

## Strategies

### Math 

There are 45 questions with 50 minutes to do them. The first 30 or so questions will be easier and take less than a minute to complete as long as you know what the questions are about. If you are good at math you should rush through the start and then focus on the harder ones. It has a lot of Geometry and Algebra, with a little pre-calc. 
### Science 

40 questions and 40 minutes. It is taken at the end and that can lead to people doing worse on it. Knowing basic knowledge about science should be enough for it. Read the context first and annotate everything, this allows for you to identify the elements later. There are times when 2 hypotheses are given, the 7 questions will be split between and it is better to answer the questions for the specific passage before reading the next one. There are 2 other types of passages data representation and research summary. Data has tables you have to interpret. Research is mainly text.  
### English 

50 questions in 35 minutes. It will have a literary narrative, an argumentative passage, and 2 informative passages. In English the type is not as important as it is just fixing the grammar and tone. It is always good to look at the commas and know the rules of grammar. There will be a NO CHANGE answer every 5 approximately.  
### Reading 

30 questions in 30 minutes. There are 4 passages passages with around 7-8 questions for each. They are: prose fiction, social science, humanities, and natural science. A good strategy is to go to the one you are good at first and do the one you are worst at last. Read the questions first and look for the local questions, the ones with the line number in them, and bracket the location in the passage with the question number next to them. You can answer the question as you read it. After you are done with the passage, then answer the global questions. The main idea question is one of the easiest as just by looking at what was mentioned and how broad the question is, it can be identified.
