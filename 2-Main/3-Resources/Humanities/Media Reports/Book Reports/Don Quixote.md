### Overview

From the 1600s it is a parody of tales of knights which were very popular at the time. The main character is a delusional noble that thinks that he is a knight. He goes on adventures trying to save his fake damsel in distress and stop the evil wizard that burned down his books. Which was actually just his butler.
