# All Quiet on the Western Front 
#BookReport #Ela/Classic/Modern 


## Summary

It is a story about World War I with the perspective of a German boy who got sent to fight. It is a tragic story that shows the horrors of war. Almost every character we see in the story dies a terrible death, whether it be on the front lines or due to illness. It gets its name from the personal experience of the author, whose self insert is the mean character of the story. When he returned home on break he saw that a newspaper stated that there was nothing to report on the Western Front of the war, though the author knew that there were people constantly being gassed out of the trenches and dying. He wrote the book because his story needed to be heard. 

## Interesting Points

> During a trench clearing a French soldier grabs barbed wire before he is blown up leaving only his hands on the wire to show that he was in that fight. 

Seeing a person become an object is really strange to the brain. 

> The main character falls in a whole with a French man who he later ends up killing, looking in his pockets, he sees a pendent with a woman on it. The main character laments that he could have been his friend if not for the war.

Just wearing different colors made the people think that the others are not people. Only after realizing that everyone is human is when your feelings start to come into play. 

> When the main character gets back home, there are people that think they know more than him about the war even though they were not there because he is just a young boy. 

Elders are used to being the people that know more than younger people. To the point where they dismiss the opinions of young people. This is that Status Quo, though things like war or other terrible events can change how people experience this. Because [[People will Hear What They want to Hear]].
