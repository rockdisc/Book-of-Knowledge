## Summary 

A play by [[William Shakespeare]]
**Act 1–2:**  
Don Pedro, a nobleman, returns to Messina with his men after a war, including Claudio and Benedick. Claudio falls for Hero, the daughter of the governor Leonato, and plans to marry her. Meanwhile, Benedick and Beatrice (Hero’s cousin) constantly exchange witty insults and deny any romantic feelings.

Don Pedro helps Claudio woo Hero, and they become engaged. At the same time, Don Pedro and his friends decide to trick Benedick and Beatrice into falling in love with each other by making them overhear staged conversations suggesting the other is secretly in love.

**Act 3–4:**  
The matchmaking works—Benedick and Beatrice begin to fall for each other. However, Don John, the villainous brother of Don Pedro, plots to ruin Hero and Claudio's wedding. He deceives Claudio into believing Hero has been unfaithful.

At the wedding, Claudio publicly shames Hero. She faints from shock and is believed dead. To clear her name, the Friar devises a plan to pretend Hero is dead while the truth comes to light.

Meanwhile, a bumbling constable named Dogberry accidentally uncovers Don John's plot when his men arrest Borachio, Don John's accomplice.

**Act 5:**  
Don John's scheme is exposed. Claudio, believing Hero is dead, is filled with remorse and agrees to marry an unknown niece of Leonato's as penance. At the wedding, the “niece” turns out to be Hero, alive and vindicated.

Benedick and Beatrice also confess their love and agree to marry. The play ends with a double wedding and celebration, while Don John is captured.
