People who get the best grades do not study all the time, instead they focus hard on the time they decide to study. To do this there are a few steps.

1. Be selective of your work environment
Areas with distractions can cause you to not focus on what you are doing, instead they will actively lessen the amount of work you will do. If you cannot move locations, you can rearrange the things in your own location to fit. Try to make them fit the vibe you go for. 
For me technology is useful but distracting. When I am doing something that does not require it, I like moving to my other desk for minimal distractions. Creativity can increase just by having something that is not in order next to you. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> Have different modes within my laptop or change desks for different things I do. Because things like doing worksheets and debate work only requires a notebook or laptop, I can do it at my other desk to stop the distraction of my phone and laptop. 

2. Your time boxes have to be made out of cast iron
Whatever time you set out to do things, you have to only do those things and not get distracted. If there is a box around you while doing something, checking your phone in the middle of it is like tearing a hole in it. The more holes there are the harder it is to focus. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> Turn on personal mode on my phone while doing work and start a timer for the work I want to get done. Or pick a time to start and stop.

3. Don't plan your day like a fool 
There are three ways to help do this. To schedule similar tasks together, have buffer time in between, and do all deep work in the morning while you have the most energy. I cannot do the last step due to school, but the others can still apply. Yes I would not do the last step even if I did not have school. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> Try not to schedule your entire day in advance as there are things that you will not know about. Just have a list of things you want to do every day and keep to it.  

4. Create a ritual before you enter deep work 
It can be very small, but after a week or so after doing it, it will help activate it whenever it is needed. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> Make it a body jester that I do not normally do so I can activate it anywhere. I would recommend something like covering my eyes with my fingers for a few seconds. It also helps calm me down. 

5. Use Idle Gaps like a smart person 
If you use distraction to fill up boredom every time, you will not be comfortable being bored. Yes people fear [[Nothing]], but it helps us grow into being better at focusing. Once a person is wired to crave distraction, they cannot do a difficult task without wanting to cheat. 

> [!tip] Recommendation 
> While waiting in line or something else idle, try to stay away from your phone and just stay still. 

6. Multi-task the right way 
Instead of doing two tasks that take up the [[Random Access Memory|RAM]] of
