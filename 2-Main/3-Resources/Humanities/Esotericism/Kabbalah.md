Each sefirot(sphere) has their own meaning along with each path.

1. Keter, Crown: Divine will and urge to create, from the [[Ein Sof]] the infinite source where the Jewish god was born from or before he developed a sense of self. Something beyond human understanding. 
2. Chokhmah, Wisdom: Wisdom from nothing, [[Ex Nihilo]]. The first power of conscious intellect, also called Sophia 
3. Binah, Intelligence: Understanding or contemplation, it is likened to a palace of mirrors which reflect and mold Chokhmah
4. Hesed, Mercy: Kindness and love show help that goes above and beyond what anyone would normally do.
5. Gevurah, Judgement/Strength: it also includes limitation
6. Tiferet, Beauty: includes spirituality and miracles
7. Netsah, Endurance/Eternity/Victory: Leadership and rally others to act
8. Hod, Majesty: the balance between the emotions and intelligence, being able to have strength and majesty while being able to submit.
9. Yesod, Foundation: It is what connects the sefirot above to the world down below, it is the power of connection and prayer
10. Malkuth, Kingdom: It is the physical world, it is the un-spritual

There is also Da'at which is the center where all 10 Sefirot are combined into 1.
