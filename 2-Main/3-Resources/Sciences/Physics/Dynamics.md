#Science/Physics/Classical 

The study of [[Force]] and their influence on motions of objects. The Counterpart of [[Kinematics]]. A lot of this research comes from [[Isaac Newton]] published in his Principia. 
![[Force]]

## Newton's First Law of Motion

> An object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by some external force.

Inertia is an objects capacity to resist changes. One must get past an object's inertia to make it move or to make it stop. Inertia is dependent on mass.

![[Net Force]]

## Newton's Second Law of Motion

>$$ 
Force = Mass \space \cdot \space Acceleration

$$ ^b3f52c

[[Force]] are equal to an object's [[Mass]] times its [[Acceleration]].

It can also be stated as:
> the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to its mass

aka

$$
a = \frac{F}{m} 
$$^f0e0d7

## Newton's Third Law of Motion

> For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction

==There can never be a single isolated force== 

It seems to say that nothing can ever move, but that is not the case as you must consider only the forces acting upon the the thing you are observing.
