Taking the [[Work & Energy#Conservation of Energy|Law of conservation of energy]]
![[Work & Energy#^a7088c]]
and the law of [[Conservation of Mass]] in Chemistry
We get the law of conservation of momentum

#### Momentum
$$
\overrightarrow{p} = m \overrightarrow{v}
$$

^6ac272

Momentum = mass times velocity and is a [[Scalar and Vector|vector]] value.

kgm/s

#### Impule

$$
F \Delta t
$$

^fde94c

[[Force]] over [[Time]] expressed in Ns, Newton seconds


### Impulse-momentum Theorem

$$
F \Delta t= \Delta P = mv_{f}-mv_{i}
