#Science/Physics/Classical 

It is a transverse [[Fundamental Forces|Electromagnetic]] [[Wave Mechanics|wave]] developed by Maxwell. Composed of oscillating electric and magnetic waves. Different frequencies produce different colors, going into past what our eyes can see.

These are called the Electromagnetic waves. All of it moves at the speed of light.

## Color 

ROYGBIV
It is the wavelength of light an object reflects, all other colors is absorbs, if it reflects all, it will be white, if it absorbs all it will be black. 

## Reflection

There is an angle of incidence, where it enters, and an angle of reflection, where it exits.

## Refraction 

Light bending between mediums like from air to water. There will be a new angle of refraction when there is change in speed of light. This is also what causes the prism effect as different wavelengths of light are slowed down differently.
