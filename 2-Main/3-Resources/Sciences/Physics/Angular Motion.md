Spin means to move along an internal axis, orbit is external.

Angular Displacement:
![[Angular Displacement#^9a80d9]]

as the same with [[Velocity]], it is measured in displacement over time, for this though it is most often called [[Average Angular Velocity]]
![[Average Angular Velocity#^ec9953]]
Measured in radians per second or rpm.

The angular acceleration is the same as regular [[Acceleration]]:

$$
\alpha = \frac{\delta \omega}{\delta t}
$$
Rotational kinematics takes direct equations from linear [[Kinematics]], though with rotational values.
