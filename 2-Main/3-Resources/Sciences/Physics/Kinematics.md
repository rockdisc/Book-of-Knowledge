It has to do with movements in the world. It was mainly figured out by [[Galileo Galilei]] during the 16th century. The counterpart of [[Dynamics]].

The main variables used in this field are:

d = displacement ![[Displacement#^dd6524]]
v = velocity ![[Velocity#^08dbf9]] ![[Velocity#^d478ed]]
a = acceleration ![[Acceleration#^de28d2]]![[Acceleration#^ec2b39]]
![[Acceleration#^81b4ee]]

t = time ![[Time#^b7f870]]

In kinematic __Acceleration is always constant__.

## Horizontal & Vertical Motion

Here are the main equations

$$
v_{t}= v_{i} + at
$$

^e6a12c

the velocity of an object at any time (t) = the initial velocity + its acceleration x time.

$$
x_{t}=x_{o}+v_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2
$$

^c75c23

The position of an object with respect to a point of origin = its original position + initial velocity x time + 1/2 acceleration x time^2

$$
v_{f}^2 = v_{i}^2 + 2ad
$$

^89ccc7

the final velocity^2 = the initial velocity^2 + 2 x acceleration x displacement

Other supplemental equations that can be derived are such:
$$
d= (\frac{v _{f}- v_{i}}{2})t
$$

^673c70

position(displacement) = average velocity x time

In vertical motion, all acceleration will be due to Earth's [[Gravity]]. which is around -9.8m/s^2

negative is always toward the ground

Projectile Motion:

Vertical and horizontal movement is always separate.

You do each separately and find the final answer.
