The inevitable partial loss of an engine's ability to convert [[Heat and Temperature|heat]] [[Work & Energy|energy]] into work. It is a state function measured in J/k, represented by (S).

$$
\Delta S=\left( \frac{Q}{T} \right)_{R}
$$
The change in entropy = Heat / [[Kelvin]] Temp of a reversable process 

To show that the universe is always leading toward more entropy we have this equation:

$$
S=k \ln W
$$
Entropy = the Boltzmann constant(1.38 x 10^-23 kg/s^2K) natural log of the number of microstates
