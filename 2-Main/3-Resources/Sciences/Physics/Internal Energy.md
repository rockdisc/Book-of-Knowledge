The internal energy of a substance(U) = the sum of all the molecular potential [[Work & Energy|energy]] and molecular kinetic energies. It is directly proportional to the [[Heat and Temperature|temperature]] of the substance. An object does not contain heat, heat is the transfer of internal energy. Conservation of energy also applies to internal energy, modifying the equation as such:

$$
\delta PE + \delta KE + \delta U = 0
$$
