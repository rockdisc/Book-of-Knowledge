## Elastic

Remain separate after collision.
Total Ke will be conserved.

## Inelastic

2 objects collide and join together
Just add the [[Conservation of Momentum|momentum]] together
Total momentum is conserved but total Kinetic is not. Turns into sound and heat

$$
m_{1}v_{1} + m_{2}v_{2} = (m_{1} + m_{2})v_{f}
$$
