The [[Centripetal Force]] that causes the orbits of the planets is that same as the force that causes things to fall down on Earth. [[Gravity]].

$$
F_{g}=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}
$$

^bbfad2

the magnitude of the gravitational [[Force]] = the [[Gravity|Gravitational Constant]] x the 2 masses of objects over their distance squared.

For the radius, take it from the center of an object's mass because gravity does not depend on volume. 

All objects fall at the same speed no matter their [[Mass]] because the bigger the object, the stronger its inertia.
Putting that in an equation and using F=ma can lead us to this. 

$$
F_{g}=G \frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^2}=m_{1}a
$$
m1 is the mass of the falling object which is on both sides of the equation so it can be cancelled out leaving us this:
$$
a=G \frac{m_{earth}}{r^2}
$$
It is seen here that the [[Acceleration]] due to gravity does not include the mass of the smaller object.
