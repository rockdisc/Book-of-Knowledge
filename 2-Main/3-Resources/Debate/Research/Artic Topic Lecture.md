##### Resolved: The United States Federal Government should significantly increase its exploration and/or development of the Artic.

# Overview of Artic

Named after the constellation [[Ursa Major]]

## Geographically 

Land, sea, and Ice 66.5$\degree$ North, or above the [[Artic Circle]].

![[Artic Circle]]

## Geopolitically 

The Artic States are:
Russia, Canada, Denmark(Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US(Alaska). This can raise issues for things like the Artic Council because of the amount of land each owns. 50% is Russian.

## Climatically 

Daily [[Heat and Temperature|temp]] does not exceed 10$\celsius$. 
This definition means that the artic is shrinking with climate change, I could see some [[Topicality|T]]s that say that the plan does not cover the climatic artic, or [[Affirmative|Aff]]s that it does not apply because that is not part of the artic anymore. 

## Artic Exceptionalism 

This can be used to say there will be no conflicts in the Artic, as it has not happened before. 

## Artic Council 

Cute fox. 8 states, 6 permanent participants(native groups), working groups, and 38 observers. 

The participants are the AIA, ICC, AAC, Saami, GCI, and RAIPON. ICC is the most active. 

Kenneth Hoegh is the chair. Norway used to be leader, now handed off to Denmark. 

[[UNCLOS]] applies in this sea, there could be plans that are just making the US sign it. 

There is an agreement for scientific collaboration between the nations, will have to see if this includes the participants, if not it will be a major [[Kritik|K]] opportunity. 

## Indigenous Peoples of the Artic

3-1 ratio between settlers and indigenous peoples

## Climate Change
