A way of getting the average of a [[Slope]]. You find the farthest points in a [[Domain]] given. then do this to them:

$$
Average \space Rate \space of \space Change = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}= \frac{f(x){2}-f(x)_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$
This can be used to solve this example problem:

What is the average rate of change on $f(x) = x^3 + 4x \space on \space [-1,2]$? 

$f(-1)=1-4$

$f(2)=-8+8$

so putting that back in the equation. 
$\frac{0+3}{2+1}=1$
would be the answer.
