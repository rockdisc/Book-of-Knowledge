#Math/Algebra 

It is a way of measuring different types of [[Slope]], also called rate of change. It is confusing to start as it is not whether or not [[Functions]] are positive or negative, but their rate of change. 

## Concave Up
When the rate of change is increasing. So when a slope goes from -5 to -1/2.
## Concave Down  
When it decreases.
