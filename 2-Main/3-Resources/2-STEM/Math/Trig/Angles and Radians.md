## Angles 

Between 2 Lines that intersect, there is an angle, measured in $\theta$. It is normally put on the coordinate plane. One of the Rays is going to be on the x-axis with the angle on the origin. Degrees are what we used to use to measure an angle where there are 360 degrees in a full rotation. 

## Radians 

![[Radian_cropped_color.svg]]

A radian is a sector with an arc length equal to the radius. ![[Circumference]]

This means that a full rotation would be 2$\pi$ radians $\approx$ 6.28 $\theta$

so $\pi$ radians is 180, $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is 90, and so on. 

We can go above 2$\pi$ as it would just loop around the circle. **Coterminal angles** are angles that end at the same stop, even if they get there by looping or by negatives, they always differ by 2$\pi$n. 

### Convert between Degrees and Radians 

$$
R=\left( \frac{D}{180} \right) \pi
$$
$$
D=\left( \frac{R}{\pi} \right) 180
$$
