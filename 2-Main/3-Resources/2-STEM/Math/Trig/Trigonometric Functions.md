#Math/Trigonometry 


Trig is about triangles, starting from the coordinate plane and a circle, tracing a radius up, lets say to $\frac{\pi}{4}$ [[Angles and Radians|radians]] and then drawing a line down to 0 will result in a right triangle being created. The hypotenuse will always be the same, but the legs will change lengths depending on the angle. We use trig functions to describe these side lengths.

$$
\sin \theta= \frac{opposite}{hypotenuse}
$$
$$
\cos \theta= \frac{adjacent}{hypotenuse}
$$
$$
\tan \theta= \frac{opposite}{adjacent}
$$
There are also reciprocals:

Cosecant 
$$
\csc \theta = \frac{hypotenuse}{opposite}
$$
Secant 
$$
\sec \theta = \frac{hypotenuse}{adjacent}
$$
Cotangent 
$$
\cot \theta = \frac{adjacent}{opposite}
$$
