When an object passes in front of another, mainly used surrounding [[Earth]].

## Solar Eclipse

When the [[Moon]] passes in front of the [[Sun]]. There are separate types of this as the moon at some points can cover the entire thing, at others it cannot. 

### Total Eclipse 

The Moon totally covers the Sun, leaving just the [[Corona]] showing in a white glow. 

### Partial Eclipse 

The Moon covers a part of the Sun, looking like a crescent. 

### Annular Eclipse 

When the Moon covers the Sun, but it is too far away, or we are too close to the sun, so the Corona does not appear, looks like a ring. 

## Lunar Eclipse 

When the [[Moon]] goes into the [[Earth]]'s shadow. This makes it look red. It is also how some people were able to figure out the radius of the Earth.
