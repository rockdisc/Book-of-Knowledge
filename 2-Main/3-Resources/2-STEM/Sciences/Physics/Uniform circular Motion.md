The axis or rotation is at the center of the rotating object, it is what the things on the radius of the object rotate on. To describe the movement of an object rotating we use tangential motion as the object is always trying to go on a tangent from the object. If the tangential speed is constant, it is called uniform circular motion.
Centripetal [[Acceleration]] is what keeps the object moving in a circle as it is a [[Scalar and Vector|vector]] that always points to the center of the circle. 

The closer an object is to the axis of rotation, the less distance it has to move, and so the slower speed it as, vice versa for longer distances. This is because of the equation for speed:

$$
speed = \frac{distance}{time}
$$
So the shorter the distance the slower the object as time of rotation stays constant,

Centripetal acceleration is thus:

$$
a_{c} = \frac{v_{t}^2}{r}
$$
tangential speed^2 over the radius. [[Dynamics#Newton's Second Law of Motion|Newton's Second law of motion]] ![[Dynamics#^b3f52c]]
so there needs to be a force in this acceleration, that is the [[Centripetal Force]] ![[Centripetal Force#^778dc6]]
Yes it is just a rebrand, no you do not have to memorize this.
Combining the two equations together will result in the one you do need to memorize:

![[Centripetal Force#^46680c]]

The centrifugal force is not a real force and is just the inertia of your body trying to move in the tangential motion to the axis of rotation.
