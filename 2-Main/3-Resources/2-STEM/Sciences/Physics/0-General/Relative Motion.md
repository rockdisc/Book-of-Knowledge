#Science/Physics 

Heavily studied by [[Galileo Galilei]], Everything in the universe is moving, but we do not need to think about all of that in regular calculations in physics. So things called Inertial Reference Frame, when we pretend a moving object is not moving. For the AP Physics test, it can be taken as [[Scalar and Vector|vector]] addition in one dimension. This would just mean subtracting the two speeds. 

A reference frame has 3 things:
- Object of reference 
- Coordinate origin 
- Time interval
