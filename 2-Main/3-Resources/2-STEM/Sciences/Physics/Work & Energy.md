#Science/Physics 

Work is an action done to an object that displaces the object
Force x distance = work
It is only the component of [[Force]] that parallels the displacement that counts to work.

$$
W=Fd \cos \theta
$$
it is [[Scalar and Vector|scalar]]

Energy is the capacity to do work

$$
W _{net} = \Delta KE 
$$
#### Kinetic Energy
The energy an object has due to its motion


#### Potential Energy

Energy be location in a field

## Conservation of Energy

There will always be the same amount of mechanical energy, but the kinetic and potential energy can change. 

$$
\frac{1}{2} mv_{i}^2 +mgh_{i} = \frac{1}{2} mv_{f}^2 + mgh_{f}
