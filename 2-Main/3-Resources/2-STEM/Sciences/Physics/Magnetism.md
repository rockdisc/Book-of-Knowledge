Bar magnets have poles, the North and South poles, which are their [[Electricity|charge]] and act like that. The only difference is that charges can be isolated while the poles have to stick together. This works because of their [[Electron Configuration]]. When their spins align, they will be magnetic. They have a closed field. The electric field can interact with the magnetic field and vice versa. This is because they are both part of the same [[Force]], [[Electromagnetism]]. 

## Right hand Rule 

Point your right thumb the direction of the current, the magnetic field rotates the way your fingers are curled.
