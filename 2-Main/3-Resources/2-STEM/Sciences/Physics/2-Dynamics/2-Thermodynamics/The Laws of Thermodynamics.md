Deals with the behavior of [[Heat and Temperature]] and [[Internal Energy]]

Some definitions:
![[System(Physics)]]
![[Surroundings(Physics)]]

## 0th Law

> If two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system then those two are in thermal equilibrium with each other

Explained in [[Logic Statement]]s:

$$
(q = x \land p = x) \implies (p = q)
$$


## 1st Law 

Outlines the relationship between internal energy(U), [[Work & Energy|work]](W), and heat(Q)

$$
\Delta U =Q-W
$$
All measured in joules, it means that the change of internal energy = energy transferred as heat - the energy done by work. There are some other inferences we can make with this. When heat is absorbed the sign is positive, when work is done by the system it is positive. 

### Isovolumetric 

Constant Volume means that there is no working being done to they system, which means all of it would be done by heat transfer. 

### Isothermal

Constant Internal Energy would mean that internal energy = 0 and all heat transferred to the system is being used for work, like when changing between the [[Three States of Matter]].

### Adiabatic

No heat transfer in the system means that all internal energy is being used to do work. 

### Isolated

No heat transfer or work being done means nothing happens.

## 2nd Law

> No cyclic process can convert heat into work with 100% efficiency.

Also stated that heat always flows from high temperature to low temperature. 

![[Entropy]]

It can also mean
$$
\Delta S_{univ}=\Delta S_{sys}+ \Delta S_{surr}
$$
and 
$$
\Delta S_{univ} = 0
$$
But there is no reversable process so it should actually be:
$$
\Delta S_{univ}>0
$$
This means the entropy of the universe is always increasing. 


## 3rd Law


It talks about the absolute coldest [[Heat and Temperature|temperature]]. This is 0 [[Kelvin]]

> The entropy of any crystalline substance at absolute zero will be equal to zero.

Or 
$$
S=0
$$
Because [[Absolute Zero]] cannot be reached, the law is rephrased as such:

> It is impossible to lower the temperature of any system to absolute zero in a finite number of steps.
