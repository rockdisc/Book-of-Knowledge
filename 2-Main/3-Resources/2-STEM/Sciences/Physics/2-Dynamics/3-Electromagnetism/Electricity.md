## Electric Charge 

Rubbing a balloon on your hair will make your hair stand. This is an example of an electric charge. Your hair becomes positively charged, and the balloon become negatively charged. These terms were coined by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Opposites attract and like charges repel. These are carried by [[Subatomic Particles]] such as the proton(+) and electron(-). Electron transfer is what makes electric charge. An electron carries 1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs. 

Conductors can easily transfer electric charge. 
Insulators do not transfer electric charge. 

Opposite charges attract. as seen in Coulomb's Law:

$$
F = k \frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^2}
$$
The [[Scalar and Vector|magnitude]] of the electric [[Force]] = Coulomb's constant(8.99x10^9 N m^2/C^2) x the charge on both objects over their radius squared. 

It is almost a carbon copy of [[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]]
![[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation#^bbfad2]]

The only difference is that the electric force can be $\pm$ while gravity can only be positive. 

## The Electric Field 

Much stronger than the [[Gravity|gravitational field]]. It is what allows for the electric field to propagate. These is the equation for the electric field strength:

$$
E= k_{c} \frac{q}{r^2}
$$
The strength of an electric field generated by a point charge = Coulomb's constant x the charge on the object over the distance from the object generating the field to some other object. 

We draw these fields through electric field lines which point from positive to negative. That is called an **electric dipole**. The more densely packed the lines, the stronger the force. 

## Potential 

Just like [[Gravity|gravitational]] [[Work & Energy|potential energy]], there is also electric potential energy. Opposite charges attract, so that can create potential energy. The field does the work to get the [[Acceleration]].

$$
PE_{electric}=-qEd
$$

For a uniform field, the magnitude of this change= the opposite of the object's charge x the electric field strength x the displacement from some reference point.

## Current  

Particles can move and generate current, like in a river. It exists when there is a net movement through a medium.

$$I= \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$

The total charge passing through a given area over a time interval. It is measured in Amps, which is 1 C/s.
The direction of a current is opposite of the negative charges, but can be generated by both positive and negative charges. 
## Resistance 

The ability of a material to oppose charge flow. Depends on composition and dimensions of a substance. 

$$
R= \frac{\Delta V}{I}
$$
The ratio of potential difference to current. Measured in ohms($\Omega$) V/A

## Power 

The rate at which electrical energy is converted to other forms 

$$
P = I \Delta V
$$
Measured in Watts, J/s
