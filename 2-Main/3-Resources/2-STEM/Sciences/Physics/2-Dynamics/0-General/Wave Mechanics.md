Mechanical waves are waves that move through a medium. They can either be transverse waves where the disturbance is perpendicular to the way it is travelling, or longitudinal waves where it is parallel. Mechanical waves mean that the medium does not travel with the waves, just the energy. The energy can make them travel but it is not inherently the case. 

Electromagnetic waves can travel without a medium, but they are still energy. [[Hook's Law|waves made from harmonic motion]] will always be sine waves.

Amplitude = A
wavelength = $\lambda$
period = T
frequency = $\nu$ measured in hertz


sound is a longitudinal wave through the are. 

$$
speed= \lambda \nu
