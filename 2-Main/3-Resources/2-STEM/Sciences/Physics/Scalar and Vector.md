#Science/Physics

These are different types of units. Scalar means magnitude, what it is measuring, vectors also include direction.
So distance is scalar, it cannot be negative.
Displacement is vector, it can be negative and is directional.

If a person travelled 3 miles in an hour, their speed(scalar) would be 3mph, but if they only when 1 mile in [[Displacement]](vector) it would be 1 mph in [[Velocity]]. This is because the person went straight for 2 miles and walked back 1. 

Vector forces can be added.
