In another part of the kingdom, there is a stepson who convinces his father that his legitimate brother was trying to kill him and gets him banished. King Lear soon gets tricked by his daughters who take his power and banish him along with his jester. Edmund the stepson betrays his father to join the 2 daughters saying he will play on both of their sides and will marry whichever is victorious, and so his father is banished with his eyes plucked out. Edgar, the true son, is asked by his father, who does not know it is him, to push him off a cliff. Edgar does so, but only a small one, lying to him to say it is a miracle that he survived.

## Interesting Points

It is considered one of the best plays by Shakespeare, and it can be seen why. The theme of loss blends perfectly with the symbols of vision. People lose their sight but gain it in different ways even if it is too late or have their vision taken away because they gained more.

> **“Thou art the thing itself: unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art.”**

>**“Humanity must perforce prey on itself, / Like monsters of the deep.”**
