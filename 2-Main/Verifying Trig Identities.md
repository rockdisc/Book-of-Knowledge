#Math/Trigonometry 

When you have an equation with [[Basic Trigonometric Identities]] on each side, you can use this to simplify. 

Here is an example:

$\csc x \tan x =\sec x$
this can turn into 
$\frac{1}{\sin x} \cdot  \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}=\frac{1}{\cos x}$
after the $\sin x$ cancel it leaves us with
$\frac{1}{\cos x}=\frac{1}{\cos x}$


Here is another

$\sin x \tan x + \cos x = \sec x$

##### Method 1 

$\sin x \cdot  \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} +\cos x =\frac{1}{\cos x}$
the $\sin$s can multiply and multiplying $\cos$ to $\cos x$ will e
$\frac{\sin^2x}{\cos x}$
