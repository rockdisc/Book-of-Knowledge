## Types 

There are 3 types of magic:

- Magic that comes from birth [[Curse]]
- Magic that comes from another person/being [[Bind]], [[Gift]], [[Ability(Poet's Land)]]
- Magic that can be learned [[Learned Magic]]

## Physics

### How it relates to the world
People believe that magic is like an ocean and the world is the land, and the waves(Vibra) are what effect the real world.

![[Vibra Explained]]

As seen in the drawing, in reality is is not like that. The waves of magic is actually the waves of the world itself. It is not like gravitational waves in the space-time continuum but past that. The thing that makes up the spacetime. 
The Amplitude is the amount of disturbance in space. Also called mana.

![[Mana Explained]]

This is the explanation to what mana is and where magic comes from. It is a wave with wave-particle duality, though they do not know that. Like with music, people realized that they did not have to create these waves on the spot one by one to make magic, as all spells are, including curses are made of these waves. Instead they created [[Learned Magic#Circles|Circles]] which allow for casting these spells at any time with no harm to the user, though they are very secretive.

Spells work by putting together waves of different amps together in wave syntheses to create new wave forms. The magic itself comes from assembly of the waveform, the waveform is nothing important, though the cultures of the world do not know that.

The actual amps do not matter, but their ratios do. You could have a fireball spell cast from a small rotating peace of paper as well as from the winds blowing around a mountain. The problems come in when they have absurd ratios like 1:2:15:125:120432. Which would be very are to do as they are still in the medieval ages, just coming to the first industrial revolution. 

The frequency does not really matter, but a faster frequency allows for one to cast a spell faster.

#### The mana paradox:
[[Emperor Varks]] discovered a paradox in magic. For the mana and energy put in, it seems to be doubled when it is released. The energy is doubled.
_The reason for this is because interference is reversed. This makes it so that exactly double is released_
