Gifts are given by [[Numen|elves]], who live in the [[Spirit World]]. They are a wish for more power granted by the elf after giving it a [[Ritual]] sacrifice. The price for each ritual increase every time a person does a ritual as the elf gets stronger. The requirement for the ritual can be asked of by sacrificing the plant of the elf and asking for what they want. They will most often ask for an [[Epitome]] of a being that is opposed to them. The elf can grant a power in your body that is specific to the elf. This can be used for [[Ikon]]s as a way they can make their body accommodate an [[Epitome]]. People that are not [[Curse]]d can also ask for a gift, this can let them control their body more or gain a new power.
