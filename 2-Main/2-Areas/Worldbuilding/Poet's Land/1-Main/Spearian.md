The language of the [[Feydil Empire]] now used in [[Witlan]] and [[Feydilin]] with a deviation in [[Kabir]] called Searese with similar structure and words.

These language seems to have a lot of similarities with English and upon looking into it further [[Transmigrators]] can realize that it is much easier than English to write in an iambic pentameter in which all old poetry is written in. It is not a bad guess that Shakespeare may be involved in its creation. The biggest difference it has with English which will come up in the story is that there are 3 sets of pronouns to address people's status, with one for people higher than you, one lower/informal and one for equal rank.
