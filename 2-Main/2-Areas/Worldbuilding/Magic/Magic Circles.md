Used for repeatable and cheaper spells (half the cost). The ink used in circles depends on the contents of the spells, fire spells use fire ink and so on. Elemental ink can be made with the blood of monsters that use the element. (blood of an arctic wolf for ice, etc.) Take principals from engineering and coding. When writing in the circle, be very precise like legalese.

### Elements of a Magic Circle:
![[Magic Circles of Manabrew.png]]
- Outer Ring
	- The activation requirement, like on touch cast spell 5 feet in front of caster unless obstructed, then find nearest open space
	- Leaving the ring blank means it activates on touch
- Secondary Ring
	- The error statement, if there is something that goes wrong that happens in the spell on error, retry once and clear error text
	- Leaving the ring blank means it aborts on fail
- Other Rings are if statements

- Inner Circles
	- Smaller spells inside the larger spell, a spark spell inside a fireball spell
	- They can have the same activation requirement as the bigger spells
- Links 
	- Lines between to circles that link them
	- Blank lines cast both spells at the same time
	- Arrows cast one after another 
	- Anything else can also be done(marking mana flowing through) or other stuff
- Outer Circles 
	- Circles linked on the outside of bigger circles
	- This is like function or different method/class
	- Connecting lines are used as parameters(things that bring variables from the big circle to the outer circle)
- Glyphs 
	- Players can make their own as long as they are consistent
