#Worldbuilding/History 
Before the Cavum there was the wastelands, a frozen place that covered the planet, at this time there were giant human like creatures called Titans, all they would do is fuck and fight, they ranged from the size of several mountains to the size of 2 humans. Then the Cavum appeared, from them the gods, they fought with the titans and won.

From Pluvia came hundreds of many eyed angels that cried creating the seas and drowned the Titans

From Scovis came the land and buried the Titans, they tried to fight it, crushing the land into sand but they got overwhelmed.

From Nubes came fog which triggered the bells made by the Titans into turning them into stone and then the fog crushed them,

From Cresco came the Beast of the Start Times Novus that fought with the Titan king Cassus to the death, the gods seeing such great fights, they decided to have a burial for the titans that fought well in the land of swords

From Bellum came death and punishment for all the wrong doingsÂ 

People used to be killed and tortured by the titans, but not the non-typical DND races, there is no record of them getting tortured by titans leading to discrimination of the normal races saying that they did not need to deal with the torture. Some hyper religious atypical race priests think that they came from the Cavums
