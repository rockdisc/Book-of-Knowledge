#Worldbuilding/Location 

## The Country of Sand and Glass 

Mainly sell glass goods in exchange of agriculture and food. 

Very large sand dunes in this entire area that are very good to turn to glass. There are things called [[Glassblower Dragon]]s which create glassforms within the sands. 

### Lake Con 

It is a pretty big lake which is most well known for having so much silica that it is undrinkable. 


## Confeld, The City of Molten Sand 

Located within a city sized glassform, which they say was build by Skolgram and settled by Skandrok. Modern evidence says that it was most likely a meteor. There is a city in the area is because it acts as a water basin and its glass is a very expensive good.
