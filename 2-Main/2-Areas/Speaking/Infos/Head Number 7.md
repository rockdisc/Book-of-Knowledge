Head Number 7 was sold for $1000.

In 2023 an investigation by the Pennsylvania Attorney’s Office revealed that the morgue director at Harvard was taking body parts from the morgue and selling them online. They were not able to find how many were stolen and sold to how many people, all we know is that his last trade, 8 parts were sold and the only evidence of the trade was a Paypal receipt that read “Head Number 7 SOLD: $1000” 

The red market for human bodies and body parts is thriving, as shown by anthropologist Scott Carney, who went to the affected locations to get firsthand information and wrote the book The Red Market, which pushed this market into the limelight for the first time since 1985. 

These bodies go around the world, as said by later self-reflection Harvard study, the cadavers and skeletons go to universities for medical study and the body parts; they go everywhere from collectors to religious traditions

So, I will start by explaining how this relates to me, and my motherland, India; you, and the country we live in; and finally us, how this affects the world in total.

As seen from a recent paper by Sabrina Agarwal, India has been the epicenter of global bone and organ harvesting for most of modern history. These bones are obtained from graverobbing, and organs are “donated” from people trying to pay off their debts. PICTURE It's gotten to a point where there are tribes that hunt other tribes just to sell their organs, again revealed by Scott Carney.

This got to a point where in 1984 according to the Chicago Tribune 60,000 skulls and skeletons were being exported out of India. A single factory in the City of Bones, Kolkata, would earn a million dollars a year, that is 3 million today, and this was during an economic reform in India.

This came to a head a year later when Indian authorities caught 1500 child skeletons being exported out of the country, reported by the Chicago Tribune. This led to the National Import/Export Control Act which tried to stop it. And it worked for a while, exports out of the country are at an all time low, but it did not stop all of it. In 2009 The National reported the Indian police caught a man exporting 67 skulls and 10 bones. He also said that he has been doing this for 10 years. It seems that all this bill did was stop the public trade of our bodies.

Now let's go to the other side of the coin. We have been talking about where the cadievars come from, so let's now talk about where they go.

A lot of doctors use cadavers in their training, and it works, the natural institute of health says it's one of the best ways to get hand on training. We have been doing it for a while, and this is not where the problem lies. The problem is how they get these bodies. 
Throughout the ages, many people wanted to be doctors, so what did they do before the 1800s, graverob. According to the American College of Surgeons the red market started when these graverobbers would sell the dead bodies to the universities. They realized it was a problem and states individually passed acts that both illegalized possession of illegally obtained bodies, and allowed universities to take unclaimed bodies from morgues. This is still active today. 

As said by the National Health Institute, the most common ways of procuring a body are donations, importing bodies from other countries, and taking bodies that are left in morgues due to not having any living relatives or the relatives not being able to afford a burial.

Now I am not saying that it is only America that takes the bodies of the poor, we can see this in India too, with their journal of medical ethics talking about the issue of doing this when unclaimed bodies are, sad to say, easy to come by. But this is still a problem, especially after the case in Harvard with the sale of the body parts. 

This brings us here to the world at large. Where the people training to save lives have to take bodies from people unwilling. 

A study from NIH illustrates that of the 71 countries surveyed, around half the countries that have medical schools, 48 of them rely on unclaimed bodies and only 22 use only donated bodies. 
And there are countries that do not have enough bodies even if they take the unclaimed ones, so what do they do? They import bodies. Yes there is a completely legal world corpse trade PICTURE.

According to a Harvard study, bodies from across the world get transported into medical labs. The main contributors to this trade, also supported by the export stats from the prior NIH study, are the U.S. and India. The entrepreneurial spirit of America led some people to go around those anatomy laws to move these bodies. In short, these bone brokers realized that the laws prohibit buying and selling, but not adequate price for procurement. 

They could get these bodies from places not documented if you catch my drift, like the many unclaimed bodies in India, or like at the start of this speech, their occupation at a university. 
Wait a second. People obtaining bodies so that they can sell them to universities or collectors for profit, what does that remind me of? This is the graverobbing of the 19th century again, but at a worldwide scale. People are making a living on moving and selling human bodies, every single day moving bodies all across the world. In the end, impoverished people around the world are having their bodies stolen to be sold. Bodies are being treated like a commodity and not like the person they were. There is a chance our relatives could be forced to be a part of this morbid system. Thank you.
