#Story 

## Act 1: Elder
A right hook crashes into my jaw, this might be how I die; getting pummeled by my brother. Another punch hit my ribs, I think it broke one; Man it hurts so bad, but I guess it doesn’t matter does it? I mean, I am going to die in a few minutes anyway. We used to be so close, what happened to us?

<hr>

“What are you holding Big Bro?” Questioned a young boy wearing bunny-eared flip-flops and Pikachu overalls. He looked about 4 years old and was holding an old teddy bear, my old teddy bear.

“Nothing,” I said, putting away my lighter. Questioning back I said, “Why are you awake?”

“I had a bad dream, and… I didn’t want to wake Mama up”

Good idea, kid, smart. “Fair, but you should go back to sleep, we will wake her up if we keep talking.”

“Can you come with me? I’m still scared”

What should I tell him, if I go with him to our bedroom, he will cry if I don’t sleep with him. But I want to hit this…
No, I should go with him, I can hit it tomorrow.

<hr>

“You …” He screamed slurs that I couldn’t hear due to the blood in my ears. Slamming me against the wall he yelled even more. I could hear even less now because my ears were ringing from the impact. As if that wasn’t enough he kicked me. He kicked me with that scarred leg. 

<hr>

In the distance, there was a crash. A teen crashed into a tree while riding a blue bike two sizes too small for him. A bit further in the distance, there was a laugh. The bike had its front handlebar broken in half and the wheel flew off, but the rest of the bike looked fine. 
The boy had a tear in his leg that stretched from his ankle to his knee. Coming closer I saw that he was holding back tears and a bloody branch on his side.

“You ok?” I asked him, putting away my fix.

“Hey bro, yea I’m alright,” he whimpered, clutching his leg. “Well, as alright as I will be with a giant gaping wound in me.”
I hesitated, this was probably the first time he talked sarcastically to me. It was probably because he was in so much pain

<hr>

My vision is getting blurry, my head is throbbing, and I don’t think I can stand any longer. As I think that, I fall to the ground, leaning against the wall expecting another blow from him. But there wasn’t one. With what is left of my strength I move my hand to wipe the blood off my eyes to look at my brother. Is he crying?

“... Mike …”

That is all I could understand between his gasps for air and my heaving for life. That name sounded familiar, might have been one of his friends, oh yeah didn’t one die recently?

<hr>

“Hey Andre,” called out my brother. He turned twenty-one a month or two ago and partied every night after, and it seems finally being able to drink legally was the best thing to happen to him. “This is my homie, Mike, he is gonna hang with me at the house for a bit,” he slumped his arm around Mike's shoulder as they entered the house.

“How's it going,” retorted Mike, giving me a look of recognition.

I feel like I’ve seen him before, but I don’t know where. If he doesn’t want to speak in front of my brother, then it's probably fine if I don’t remember.

<hr>

“WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME?” yelled my brother. The first clear sentence I have heard since this started, is probably also my last, judging that he started wailing on me again. 

“Don’t…hate…me” I let out in my last breath, trying and failing to caress his cheek. I don’t want my brother to hate me. I want him to know that I did everything for him. I want him to know I love him, even if he hates me.

<hr>

## Act 2: Younger

The bastard is finally dead. Don’t hate me, yeah like I could ever do that. I can never and will never forgive him for what he did. Panting, I walk to the bathroom to wash my hands of his blood. He didn’t even scream or say anything until his last breath, he must have been high till his last breath. Just like Mike.

<hr>


“Hey man I gotta tell you something” spat out Mike “It’s been killing me on the inside hiding it from you”

“What?” I inquired, thinking that it couldn’t be that bad, I mean I had known this guy for years, we knew each other's worst secrets and truths.

“Your brother is my dealer.”

“What?”

“Yeah, I tried talking to him about it but I don’t think he recognizes me,” he got out, shaking a bit. “He really is as bad as you say he is.”

“Why didn’t you tell me?” I barked. Even though I could figure it out.

“Well if I told you would rat him out-”

“Damn right, I will,” I retorted in rage.

“Well if you did that, I would be out of a dealer wouldn’t I?” He snapped back in an instant.

“I guess you're right,” I murmured.

…

He died 3 days later of an overdose.

<hr>


I should have stopped him, dammit. I should have grabbed him by his collar and forced him into rehab. I should have reported Andre, getting him in jail for everything he did. Well, he’s in a worse place than jail now so I guess it doesn’t matter now. 

I hope Mike is happy with what I did, he seemed like the type that would want revenge. Reminds me of when we first met.

<hr>

Biking down the street I see a kid with dirty brown hair sitting on the curb with a red bike lying down to the right of him. He was holding a phone, not using it, but throwing it a few inches in the air and catching it on its way down. 
As I got closer to him, I saw he was motioning me to get closer to him. When I did, he started talking. “How’s it going man?”

“Pretty good,” I answered a bit confused. “Do I know you?”

“Now you do, my name’s Mike, and I live on block 3. I’m a freshman and my dad tells me I will go nowhere in life. You?”

“Olli, the rest is the same as you but swap dad with mom.”

“Ollie, like the skateboard trick?” he joked.

I gave him a deadpan expression.

He shrugged and started digging into the pocket of his baggy jeans pulling out a bag of gummies. He looked over at me and asked, “You want one, 5 mills?”

“No,” I stated bluntly. “Got a bad experience with them.”

“Suit yourself,” he said as he started chewing on one and putting the bag away.

Judging that we had nothing else to do, we started talking. He told me that his dad, well his stepdad, works at our school as a janitor. I told him about my mom and what happened to my dad. We talked for a while, but near the end, I mentioned my brother. “Yeah, my brother is like 10 years older than me. He was actually supposed to be watching me out here.”

“What do you mean?” Mike inquired.

“Well my mom finally decided it was time to act like one, something about ‘this is the age where you get the most hurt’, so she asked my brother to watch out for me, but he left me to go with his friends and get a fix.”

“Damn, you mean like…”

“Yeah, the hard stuff.”

“Want to get revenge?”

“What?”

“You know,” He cracked a giant toothy grin. “Get your brother in trouble for not watching you.”

“How do I do that?”

“You see that tree over there?”

<hr>

If only I had stopped Andre. If only I knew what he was doing when he was supposed to be watching me. It was probably one of his first deals, too. If I stopped him then, would Mike have survived?

No, that bastard would have continued even in the slammer. That one thing I gotta give my brother. He really is persistent and stubborn. Funny how I only remember the good things about him after he died. Well to be fair, he never was himself when he was alive anyway, even when we were young.

<hr>


I woke up from a bad dream. I can’t remember what it was, but I am still scared. What if when I sleep it comes back? I look to my right to see if my brother is still in bed with me. He isn’t, where did he go?

Still scared, I get up and put on my bunny-eared slippers. Clutching Mr. Teddy for strength, I walk out. Walking down the hallway, I see Mama’s bedroom, should I wake her up?

No, she would get mad and hit me, my brother is my best bet. Walking further down the hallway I see a flickering light. As I get closer I can smell something weird.

“What are you holding Big Bro?” I asked.

“Nothing,” He said, shutting off the lighter but not trying to hide it. “Why are you awake?”

“I had a bad dream, and… I didn’t want to wake Mama up”

“Fair, but you should go back to sleep, we will wake her up if we keep talking,” he said as he smoked a roll of burning paper.

“Can you come with me? I’m still scared”
He looked at me, I could almost see his train of thought. Taking the roll out of his mouth, he picked me up and walked back to our room. Is he going to sleep with me?

No, he set me down on our bed, wrapped a blanket around me, patted my head, and put the roll back in his mouth. He left out the door and locked it.

<hr>

I didn’t sleep for a while that night. I didn’t realize it back then, but he put drugs over his own brother. And now I know that he puts drugs over others' lives. High until his last breath. 

Police sirens are coming from outside the door. Neighbors must have called because of my yelling.

Looking up at the bathroom mirror, the face of a murderer; even worse, a murderer that doesn’t even regret it. About to be thrown into the slammer with a dead best friend, a dead brother, and a mother who doesn’t care for him.


Pathetic.
