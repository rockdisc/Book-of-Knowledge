# Numen

People born on the [[Ley Line|Declination line]] have the [[Curse]] of being able to affect one self. It allows them to become elves. They are tied to the [[Spirit World]] by being in a higher location of the [[Tree of Life]] at the [[Numen Canopy]]. 
## Advancing
There are 2 ways to advance for each of the types. 

- To consume an [[Epitome]] of another being in that same path(they will lose themselves if they do another path.)
- Act and create based on your power.

Consuming an epitome means that epitome has to be pure or not used in an enchantment. Numen Epitomes will always try to keep their purest form as an epitome, so when a Numen dies, the epitome turns into a magical artifact. To reverse this effect, a numen must find an [[Ikon]] that can control whatever the epitome turned into and separate it. This is called a __Vestige__. 

To act on ones power means to completely understand what your power or powers can do. An ikon of fire can consume an epitome of water, but that does not just make him the ikon of fire and water, but also steam. Just by believing and acting on that feasible belief will let that ikon have more powers, like being able to control that steam. This can happen to people with only 1 power too.

## Transcending to Elfhood

For a numen to become an elf, they have to lose their mind, which there is no fix that or a replacement like an [[Ikon]]. Instead they have to shape their spirit to be more civilized. They do this by doing 2 things:

1. Choosing a goal that is unachievable but civilized that they can form themselves around trying to reach it. 
2. When they become elves, spreading their spirit/individuality out to weaken their animalistic tendencies.

When they are ready to become an elf, they have to make a deal with a god to kill their mind, this normally cannot be done as the [[Plain of Consciousness]] has a lot of security measures, as does the [[Tree of Life]] for Ikons. 

All plants in the world are that of elves that spread out their individuality to allow themselves to maintain themselves while also making them immortal, as one has to kill all of the plants before killing an elf. 

Elves, when in need, can collapse their entire self into themselves to gain a massive boost in power, while making them a lot more animalist, it may not be able to spread its individuality again. 

As their [[Epitome]] is in the [[Material World]] as plants, they are able to change all of their part to form something else.

[[Ritual]]s can be used to contact the spirit world, this allows for elves to affect the people that cast it, allowing for [[Gift]]s to happen.

Most elves like to do gifts as their goals are either to become the strongest or understand everything, or collect everything. 

### Crossbreeds

When 2 elves copulate, it can result in a crossbreed, which is born an elf with its own plant, though they are much weaker to start in the spirt world.

Most elves respect each other and do not want to attack, as nothing can die in the spirit world, it could lead to an eternal enemy, they only attack if there is a reasonable way to make them go down to the material world and kill them there.
