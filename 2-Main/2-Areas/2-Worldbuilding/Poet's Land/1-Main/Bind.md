# Bind

Bind are ties between humans and [[Ikon]], who live in the [[Celestial World]]. This is a sort of insurance for gods. They can give some of the powers of their domains to other people(mainly their believers). This involves slight control, to make that person at a level of an [[Ikon]]. The god can decide what level of power to give that person but cannot exceed their own power. It is taken as a percentile, a god can give his pope 13% of his power. That pope can now control the waves and move water. 
This power appears as a black mark on a person with patterns that continuously cross and overlap on specific body parts. Though these body parts do not mean anything and are most often than not, hidden. Nothing happens if these body parts are cut off, the pattern goes to another spot. 
The reason it is considered insurance, and the only reason that a god would ever do this, is because if the god were to be eaten by another, they can regain the powers they have stored in their believers and killing them. This gives the gods their immortality, as if even only a person with .0001% of the power of their god is killed, the god can live. Though this would bring them down to the level of that person, only having the strength to do that thing. This is what causes [[Rapture]]s. The gods have complete control over the people they have binds with.
When killing someone with a bind, a one has to use a [[Ritual]] to ask for an elf to make it into a [[Epitome]] instead of the power going to the god. 
Binds are just a part of a uniqueness that is on top of the skin and spread out to be able to get back to the god.
