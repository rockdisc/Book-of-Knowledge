# Ikon

People born on the [[Ley Line|ecliptic line]] gain the ability to shape the surroundings around them. This [[Curse]] is that of godhood. They gain the abilities to control specific things and by consuming [[Epitome]]s, they can gain control of others. They are tied to the [[Celestial World]] by being in a higher state of the [[Plain of Consciousness]] called the [[Mountain of Ikons]]. They are the most common mages. 

## Advancing
There are 2 ways to advance for each of the types. 

- To consume an [[Epitome]] of another being in that same path(they will lose themselves if they do another path.)
- Act and create based on your power.

Consuming an epitome is pretty simple, the hard part is not losing yourself. You can just eat an epitome if you ever find one, though there is a very high chance you will lose control. What people do to circumvent this is to do a [[Ritual]] to an elf to ask for a [[Gift]], so to advance, people need 2 epitomes.

To act on ones power means to completely understand what your power or powers can do. An ikon of fire can consume an epitome of water, but that does not just make him the ikon of fire and water, but also steam. Just by believing and acting on that feasible belief will let that ikon have more powers, like being able to control that steam. This can happen to people with only 1 power too.

## Achieving Godhood

An ikon can become a god at any time, though that opens them up to being consumed by other gods and if they do not have enough believers, they will lose all sense of self and die. Though if one is successful in doing so they will gain immortality as well as a much easier way of advancing, by just eating other gods and this also means they will not need to ask for gifts. They will also be able to give [[Bind]]s. You can gain back your power lent out by causing a [[Rapture]]

To gain godhood:
1. get a following of believers that believe in exactly who you are, the more the stronger your anchor is. The stronger one is, aka the more domains they control, they stronger anchor they need.
2. Get in a good mental state, make sure you know who you are. 
3. Make a deal with an elf to kill one's spirit 
4. Ascend to the [[Blue Moon]] and use your anchors as a makeshift spirit/sense of identity.
5. You are now a god

If they loose their believers, they fade and turn into a land feature in the [[Celestial World]]
Miracle children can only be one or the other. 

### Demiurges

The body of a god is left on the [[Material World]] after their ascension, this is because a part of their epitome(the part tied to their body) is left in the world. It is not usable and does not interact with the world, it will only work if the god descends back to the world. 

Demiurges form when either their body is killed. The gods become crazed and will be able to influence the [[Material World]], causing changes in accordance with their domain. They only last for a short amount of time, as the become very vulnerable in the Celestial world. As it is not a true god, it is able to show a lot more powers in the real world, this is a threat to gods who it can take believers from.
