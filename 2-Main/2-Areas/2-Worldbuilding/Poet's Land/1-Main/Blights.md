## Animal Blights

Created when an animal is born on a [[Ley Line]] and is not able to control itself. There are a few of the intelligence species that can turn into [[Dercast]] but most lose themselves and become beasts who only want to copulate and get stronger. 
As there are so many animals that would be born on the lines, most are eaten instantly by the bigger ones which will constantly feed and find others by following the [[Epitome#Epitome Fusion|law of epitome fusion]]. This leads a lot of them to cities. 

## Human Blights

After a person loses themselves it can result in this, they are more animalistic, and may be trying to do something they were not able to in life. They are a really good source of [[Epitome]]s as animal blights are harder to hunt and are stronger. 

Any dead bodies on the lines turn into blights, though these ones do not have powers and are like zombies that try to kill others. It is the reason all [[Religious Organizations]] say to cremate all dead bodies. 

### Wyrdspawn

When a person in born on a line, they could instantly lose themselves leading to them killing their parents and anyone else around them, which then boosts themselves leading to them being able to run away and get stronger. They are the bane of mages as they still resemble children. If they are not killed when they are young, they can become stronger than human blights and overwhelm them with shear power. .

## Treants 

When plants are born on the lines they can develop mystical powers, though are actively hunted by [[Numen|Elves]] as they are an easy way of getting extra powers when they are young, and are overwhelmed by the nature around them.
