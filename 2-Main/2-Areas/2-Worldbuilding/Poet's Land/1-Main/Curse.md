# Curse

This is the magic people get when they are born on the [[Ley Line]]s. The specific power they get depend on the line, but there are things that are common among the powers. People can have either 1 or 2 powers, only if a person is born on the [[Haunt]] or the first and middle of the year on a specific location can anyone get 2 powers. These are called [[List of Miracle Children|miracle children]], though you do not want this as they are very prone to losing themselves. Whenever a person with a curse is in immense phycological stress, they disassociate with their mind, leading to the spirit taking over as their animalistic tendencies, this also leads to them killing everyone. See more in [[Blights#Human Blights|Blights]]. 
Another thing people with curses have in common, is that thing the reason people call them curses. Everyone with a curse has a sort of malformity. This is something that appears on the outside of  a body, something like an extra arm or stretchy skin. They most often somehow relate to what the power is. They also can appear when advancing, and doing the [[Ritual]] to allow for one to advance. Most children born on either of the lines, also all miracle children lose themselves at birth turning into blights, which are called [[Blights#Wyrdspawn|wyrdspawn]].  

There are not only people are born on the lines, but animals and plants too. Most of the time animals that are born on the lines lose themselves and turn into [[Blights]], but sometimes they gain intelligence and join mage society. They are called [[Dercast]]. Plants on the other hand are different. Plants that are born on the [[Ley Line]] all turn into blights, they are called [[Blights#Treants|treants]], and when they are born on the [[Ley Line]] they maintain themselves and are considered [[Numen]]. They even have the chance of becoming [[Numen|elves]].

People born on the ecliptic line are called [[Ikon]]s
People born on the declination line are called [[Numen]]

People do not know that their curse does, they have to go through trial and error to figure it out.
## Advancing 

There are 2 ways to advance for each of the types. 

- To consume an [[Epitome]] of another being in that same path(they will lose themselves if they do another path.)
- Act and create based on your power.

Consuming an epitome is pretty simple, the hard part is not losing yourself. You can just eat an epitome if you ever find one, though there is a very high chance you will lose control. What people do to circumvent this is to do a [[Ritual]] to an elf to ask for a [[Gift]], so to advance, people need 2 epitomes.

To act on ones power means to completely understand what your power or powers can do. An ikon of fire can consume an epitome of water, but that does not just make him the ikon of fire and water, but also steam. Just by believing and acting on that feasible belief will let that ikon have more powers, like being able to control that steam. This can happen to people with only 1 power too. A numen of future sight may only be able to see 1 second into the future, but may be able to predict it by doing divination, by constantly doing divination, it will start to work and he will gain that ability.
