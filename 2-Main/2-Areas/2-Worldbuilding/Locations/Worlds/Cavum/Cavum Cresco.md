From Cavum Cresco came beasts of great size, and their habitat leaked in with them. Some of the largest of these rivaled the largest of the titans. The Titan of war Cassis fight with this beast and ended in a tie of them killing each other, this is what formed the garden of fighting bones, [[Ossum]]. It is Right next to [[Adfligo]].
