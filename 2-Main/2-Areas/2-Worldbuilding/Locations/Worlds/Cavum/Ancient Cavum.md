#Worldbuilding/Consept 

Long ago there was a race of giant gods(Titans), They were as tall as mountains and strong enough to crush them, There were many of these Titans and don't ask me where they lived, like the other side of the world or something.

Even though they had this much power, they were bored so they created life, specially Ymir the titan of life

They created the giants who lived in Lapis and this was back when there was only one continent. They built massive cities, and it was a golden age of the world, they lived for centuries conversing with their gods

A giant named Stamen asked the titan Ymir how to create life, she told him and he created all of the generic DND races, Humans, Dwarves, Elves, Etc.

The giants seeing all of these creations asked for the titans to give them land of their own, the Titans said ok

And the Northern Continent was born

There is now a hierarchy of worship, the titans were the gods who were at the top, the giants who worshiped the titans, and mankind who worshiped the giants.

Mankind were treated like pets, some of them would be taken from the Northern Continent to live in Lapis and be lap dogs and the such. This is considered the second golden age. At this time Stamen created the rest of the DND races

Then came the Fall

The Cavum appeared one day, all at once, endless pits to the abyss formed

The land of swords in a the graveyard of giants, their swords lying with them, Aside from Cassis, whose sword was left in the water

To end it all, it seems that the only giants that survived were the ones far away on boats, and mankind, All the Titans either died or disappeared
