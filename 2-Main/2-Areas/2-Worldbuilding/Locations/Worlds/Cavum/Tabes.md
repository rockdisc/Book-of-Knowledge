The Isle of Sleeping Decay

It is sleeping because there are families of priests that sing the Endless Lullaby to it all throughout the land.

PLOT HOOK:

There is a part of it where the person that was supposed to sing died and it was not reported for [insert reason here]

The angel of decay start to spawn

DETAILS:

The Endless Lullaby is an ascending Shepard's Tone that can only be done by a total of 60 people Mongolian throat singing at the same octave and changing notes all at the same time no matter what else they hear or at what speed the sound travels, they take shifts of half a day, the place being so big, the singers need to walk and move to cover everything. They walk in pairs so that the singer can rest their voice and catch their breath.

There are 60 families that each sing a different note, 12 notes in total and 5 people sing each note, they are born and die on the land

No other voice other than the singing is supposed to happen, they communicate using sign language

4 times every generation, everyone stops singing, the Elderly go out to sacrifice themselves to let their children have intercourse, This happens for every elder of the family. The 5 families do it with each other in an ordered way to keep the same tone in their voices. When a child is born, a silence spell is cast so they do not cry. Only 2 children must be born 1 boy and girl. By the time they are old enough to start singing, they cannot hear the song due to it being to high to hear.

Birth of the Decay,

They are called angels because they think that this is the punishment for all the evil acts being done.

A giant passing the lullaby to a human, what actually happened, not what their religion said of Bellum Punio Starting it and Bellum Vinco giving them the song and organizing it.
