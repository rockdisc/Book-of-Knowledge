Land of Ringing Bells

Ding Dong bells make people to stone, Medusian bells

It used to be a plains but the fog turned it into a marsh, idk y its gray, for cool shit maybe, like the fog turned to liquid by condensation and turned the grass white

People think that the bells are made by the titans/giant hybrid, and that it was some weird occult rituals, they actually came from the pit
