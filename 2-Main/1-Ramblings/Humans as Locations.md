#Mini-Essay 

What happens after a man becomes a place? This is not some fantasy magic stuff, but reality. Take for example the [[Taj Mahal]], it was a tomb for Mumtaz Mahal, the wife of [[Shah Jahan]]. Her beauty in the eyes of her husband is now shown to the world in the majesty of the mausoleum. Yet it does not cover all she was. 

A person is made up of what they know, what they effect, and how others view them. [[There is no True Self]], but can be a close approximation. Now that information storage technology has gotten so advanced, the entire human brain could be stored in a place the size of a room, along with every major effect and view others had of them and they had of others. With AI, it could even be pretty accurate. Yet this is not what I am talking about, that is still trying to be a person. A memorial is not trying to be that person, but show who they were. As [[The Last Thoughts of Martyrs|martyrs]] lose their humanity, their memorials gain it.

There are flowers in the Taj Mahal that made me think of this. Shah Jahan had to tell the people to carve those flowers out of stone, a beauty he show in her, he must now see in that building.
