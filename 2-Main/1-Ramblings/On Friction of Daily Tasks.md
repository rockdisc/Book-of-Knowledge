 Friction in this context means how hard it is for you to do things. It is a basic concept really, things are easier to do when they have less friction. So to have a productive day, you should have things have less friction. Put your shoe rack right next to your door. Have notebooks to write with on your desk. This also applies in the opposite direction, if there are things you do not want to do, you should put more friction between you and it. 

## Minimizing Friction 

Putting your shoe stand next to the door is a good first step, but making it usable is the main one. When buying fancy things be sure you know how to use them. Things should be fast, intuitive(at least to you), and easy to use while being reliable. As much as [[Minimalism]] is flourishing in modern day, it is not that good at doing this. Even while entering [[Flow]], I should have everything next to me which I need. The less strength it takes to use it, the better it is for me.

## When not to Minimize 

Everyone has their rituals, things they either want to or do not want to do. If you are forced into a ritual, then yes minimize it, but not for things you like doing. to enter [[Flow]] I have a ritual, yes I could do it faster, but I do not need to. Some things do not need to be made faster. An easy way to identify them is to think, do I like doing this? Will I like it better if it were shorter? And do I truly want it shorter or am I just going on a trend in my head to make all of my life easier to do when it is not necessary?

## Needing to Maximize 

There are some things I do not want to do, but I do anyway. This is like doom scrolling, for this, create friction. A simple way of doing this is just taking the apps you use, and take them out of your home screen, instead put them in your app library taking an extra second of mindfulness before you open it to do what ever is needed to be done.
