#Worldbuilding 

I feel as though I started to world build less or worse than I have before, though that is actually a lie. I have so much thought into every aspect of all of my creations now that the old me would be astonished. Comparing [[Curse|Poet's Land]] to [[Ancient Cavum|Cavum]], Cavum looks like a hodgepodge of half-baked ideas put together in a world that barely works, but I feel I envy it more. Looking at it in the obsidian graph, it looks like a tree while Poet's Land looks like a well cohesive structure. I am looking at it at a surface level, when a person that does not know about worldbuilding, or does not care, novels like Shadow Slave seem to have better worldbuilding than Lord of Mysteries. While it is actually very incorrect. I feel there has to be a holy grail in-between these two where I can have those crazy farfetched ideas, and they would play off each other. I would like Poet's Land to be that thing, with craziness underneath the common-man's world.
