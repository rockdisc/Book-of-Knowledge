A dagger, if a person's blood gets on the dagger, after 2 more turns, the user can pick a fate to exchange with the victim. This is cancelled if the blood gets wiped off the blade, the blade gets sheathed, or the user lets go of the blade(this includes getting their hand cut off). Fates exchanged must be near equal magnitude. EX: If a person is sickly and about to die in 2 days, the fate exchanged has to be something like the birth of their child. This does not mean their child stops existing, but the child will believe their father is the victim and start to show genetic signs of the victim. The fate exchanged can be things that happened in the past. It does 1d6 pierceing damage and 3d6 psychic damage.


It cannot be held by a person, or so it seems. It actually cannot be held by anyone tied to fate. No matter how much matter you put between it and you, it cannot be drawn. A work around it is using another living object to grab it, so it is wrapped in soil and vines which need to be constantly watered. It has a mind of its own, sometimes it will exchange its own fate to not do things like changing it so that the user draws another weapon instead of drawing it. When it is used, it does 2d6 psychic damage onto the user.
