#School/StandardizedTesting 

American College Testing is a test that ranks up to 36 with anything in the high 20s being considered good, while most ivy league colleges look for a score in the 30s. When I first took it there were 4 mandatory sections: English, Reading, Math, and Science. There is also a Writing section which, unless you are going into an ELA field, there is no reason to do. Now there is only 3 sections with Science being optional, though I will still take it as I am going into a science field.
