#School/StandardizedTesting 

American College Testing is a test that ranks up to 36 with anything in the high 20s being considered good, while most ivy league colleges look for a score in the 30s. When I first took it there were 4 mandatory sections: English, Reading, Math, and Science. There is also a Writing section which, unless you are going into an ELA field, there is no reason to do. Now there is only 3 sections with Science being optional, though I will still take it as I am going into a science field.

## Strategies

### Math 

There are 45 questions with 50 minutes to do them. The first 30 or so questions will be easier and take less than a minute to complete as long as you know what the questions are about. If you are good at math you should rush through the start and then focus on the harder ones. 
### Science 


### English 


### Reading
