#School/StandardizedTesting 

American College Testing is a test that ranks up to 36 with anything in the high 20s being considered good, while most ivy league colleges look for a score in the 30s. When I first took it there were 4 mandatory sections: English, Reading, Math, and Science. There is also a Writing section which, unless you are going into an ELA field, there is no reason to do. Now there is only 3 sections with Science being optional, though I will still take it as I am going into a science field.

## Strategies

### Math 

There are 45 questions with 50 minutes to do them. The first 30 or so questions will be easier and take less than a minute to complete as long as you know what the questions are about. If you are good at math you should rush through the start and then focus on the harder ones. It has a lot of Geometry and Algebra, with a little pre-calc. 
### Science 

40 questions and 40 minutes. It is taken at the end and that can lead to people doing worse on it. Knowing basic knowledge about science should be enough for it. Read the context first and annotate everything, this allows for you to identify the elements later. There are times when 2 hypotheses are given, the 7 questions will be split between and it is better to answer the questions for the specific passage before reading the next one. There are 2 other types of passages data representation and research summary. Data has tables 
### English 


### Reading
