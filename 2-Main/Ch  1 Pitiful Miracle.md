#Writing/PoetsLand 

'Someone is watching me' was the first feeling that appeared in my head followed by the scent of burning flesh that tortured my nostrils. In front of me there was a mass of charred meat that could barely be identified as a pile of humans. Scorched bones laid underneath red-hot tendons; the only barrier separating one man from another was the ashen, putrid skin seconds away from liquefying and joining the blood and pus that was already leaking out.

I tried to look around, but then I got bombarded by the cacophony of whispers ringing in my head. It sounded like hundreds of hoarse voices of... Me? The rational part of me said that it was not my voice, yet for some reason I thought it was. There were hundreds of "me" whispering in different inflections and tones, like they were trying to imitate other voices, yet I could somehow identify all of them as mine. They repeated the same words, over and over again, but I couldn't understand what they were saying. I knew the language, Spearian. Wait no I didn't, but it felt like I did. I felt my head splitting apart as memories of herding sheep, tripping on stones near a river, and celebrating with a family not mine started to flood in. I clutched my head trying and failing to soothe the pain. As my hands cradled my temples, I realized that these were not my hands; they were far too hard and flaky. I brought them closer to observe them. They were skin and bone with singed fingertips and overgrown fingernails with some seemingly bitten off. Veins jutted out like vines crawling under my skin. Calluses covered my fingers and palms, a heatmap of activity, but that was not what suprised me
