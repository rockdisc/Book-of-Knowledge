There are 3 main formulas in [[Kinematics]]. These are:

$$
v_{t}= v_{i} + at
$$
$$
x_{t}=x_{o}+v_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
$$
v_{f}^2 = v_{i}^2 + 2ad
$$
Are three of these can be derived by knowing how to [[Graph]] [[Acceleration]], [[Time]], [[Velocity]], and [[Displacement]]. 

![[Linear Velocity Graph|5000]]

When the [[Displacement]] over [[Time]] is linear, it means that there is a constant [[Velocity]]. as velocity is the slope of that graph. As there is no change in velocity, there is no [[Acceleration]].

![[Parabolic Velocity Graph|5000]]

This shows that a change in [[Displacement]] over [[Time]] means a change in [[Velocity]]. As velocity changes, that rate of change is [[Acceleration]]. Now to get all of those equations, we have to do something a bit more complicated. 
![[Deriving Kin1 Graphically|1000]]

To get the $\Delta x$, you needed the blue, which is the [[Velocity]] it was traveling, the red, which is its change in velocity([[Acceleration]]) x [[Time]] squared, and that part should be halved because it is a triangle. This can then be re-arranged. 
I will go into a deeper explanation of the second part of the equation because it was bot explained well.
