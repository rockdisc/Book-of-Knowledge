There are 3 main formulas in [[Kinematics]]. These are:

$$
v_{t}= v_{i} + at
$$
$$
x_{t}=x_{o}+v_{i}t+\frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
$$
v_{f}^2 = v_{i}^2 + 2ad
$$
Are three of these can be derived by knowing how to [[Graph]] [[Acceleration]], [[Time]], [[Velocity]], and [[Displacement]]. 

![[Linear Velocity Graph|5000]]

When the [[Displacement]] over [[Time]] is linear, it means that there is a constant [[Velocity]]. as velocity is the slope of that graph. As there is no change in velocity, there is no [[Acceleration]].

![[Parabolic Velocity Graph|5000]]

This shows that a change in [[Displacement]] over [[Time]] means a change in [[Velocity]]. As velocity changes, that rate of change is [[Acceleration]]. 

## Equation 2
Now to get all of those equations, we have to do something a bit more complicated. Though this is the second one, it is the most 
![[Deriving Kin1 Graphically|1000]]

To get the $\Delta x$, you needed the blue, which is the [[Velocity]] it was traveling, the red, which is its change in velocity([[Acceleration]]) x [[Time]] squared, and that part should be halved because it is a triangle. This can then be re-arranged. 
I will go into a deeper explanation of the second part of the equation because it was bot explained well. 
![[Further Explanation of Deriving Kin1|1000]]
The blue part is easy enough to get, to get the area of a rectangle it is just height times width. The height is the initial [[Velocity]], the width is the [[Time]] at point $v_{f}$. The orange is harder to get. It is when there is [[Acceleration]]. It is a triangle, so the equation is $\frac{1}{2}hw$, the width is the same, time. The height is $\Delta \vec{v}$. According to the equation for acceleration:
![[Acceleration#^ec2b39]]
so it can be rearranged as:
$$
\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{a}t
$$
which plugged into the equation gets that $t^2$ which I was sweating over for a bit. 

## Equation 1

This one is pretty easy compared to the one above, though the one above was necessary to understand this. 
![[Deriving Ken2 Graphically|1000]]

This equation is used to get the final [[Velocity]], which mean there is no need to focus on blue as velocity is only the y axis. So it makes sense that the initial velocity plus the change in velocity equals the final velocity. From above, we know that:
$$
\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{a}t
$$
so substituting it in leaves us with the equation. 

## Equation 3

This comes when trying to do what equation one did without relying on time.
