Rhetorical, according to [[Aristotle]] means "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion." For the more modern way of saying it: "Techniques of language used to convey a point of convince an audience." 

Rhetoric needs 3 things to be considered good:
- Occasion 
Knowing when to use it
- Context
