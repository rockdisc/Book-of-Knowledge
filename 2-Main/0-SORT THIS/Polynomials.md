Polynomial [[Functions]] are any function representation equivalent to the analytical form: $p(x)=a_{n}x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+ \dots +a_{2}x^2+a_{1}x+a_{0}$
where $n$ is a positive [[Integer]], $a_{i}$ is a [[Real Number]] for each $i$ from 1 to $n$, and $a_{n}$ is nonzero. $n$ can also be 0.

This is the way of classifying a polynomial. Degree is the [[Exponent]].
