 Friction in this context means how hard it is for you to do things. It is a basic concept really, things are easier to do when they have less friction. So to have a productive day, you should have things have less friction. Put your shoe rack right next to your door. Have notebooks to write with on your desk. This also applies in the opposite direction, if there are things you do not want to do, you should put more friction between you and it. 

## Minimizing Friction 

Putting your shoe stand next to the door is a good first step, but making it usable is the main one. When buying fancy things be sure you know how to use them. Things should be fast, intuitive(at least to you), and easy to use while being reliable. As much as [[Minimalism]] is flourishing in modern day, it is not that good at doing this. Even while entering [[Flow]], I should have everything next to me which I need. The less strength it takes to use it, the better it is for me.
