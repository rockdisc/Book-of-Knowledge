A dagger. After striking blood with it, the user can hear/feel the thoughts of the victim. This lasts for the current and next turn. This is what is currently happening in the person's head, so in battle it is more of a feeling of how they are acting next, while in other situations it could be more of sentences. It does 1d4 piercing damage and 4d4 psychic damage. 

The user will start to here whispers randomly, sometimes saying actual words, other times pure nonsense. The user takes 1d6 psychic damage every time they use the weapon and draw blood. Randomly (when the remaining health of the victim is a multiple of 10) they will switch minds with the victim for a turn, and take the psychic damage instead. The victim can use the rest of their turn in their new body.
