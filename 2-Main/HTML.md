Hyper text markup language is a way of creating elements in websites. Here is how to set it up:

```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<title>Page Title</title>  
</head>  
<body>  
	<!-- this is a comment -->
	<h1>This is a Heading</h1>  
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<!-- All elements are enclosed <>, the thing inside tells what element it is in
	
	 -->
</body>  
</html>
```
