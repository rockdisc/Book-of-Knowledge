Hyper text markup language is a way of creating elements in websites. Here is how to set it up:

```html 
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
	<title>Page Title</title>  
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- this allows for all the styling to be in the CSS file instead of in here -->
</head>  
<body>  
	<!-- this is a comment -->
	<h1>This is a Heading</h1>  
	<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
	<!-- All elements are enclosed <>, the thing inside tells what element it is in, it is closed by </> -->

	<script src="script.js"></script> <!-- you can write JS in this file but people find it easier to write it in another file -->
</body>  
</html>
```
Most IDEs will generate this for you just by typing !. 

Here is a list of commonly used elements:
