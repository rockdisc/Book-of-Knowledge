Topic 1: Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction

The Republic of India calls upon its fellow states to proceed with the destruction and cease of stockpiling of toxin and biological weapons. These weapons have been recognized by this delegation in the past as immensely dangerous and deadly. These weapons have caused heavy casualties in many wars, including the Iraq-Iran war. Other major world powers have created and stockpiled these weapons of mass disaster to use in “self-defense”, but these retaliating actions could lead to mass death in not only the region they are targeting but the nearby peaceful regions that just so happened to be down wind. India has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention in 1996, Later declaring 1,044 tons of Sulfur Mustard in 1997. Even with constant threats at our border and the looming threat that was North of us we still, through all the hardship, became the third state to completely destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. India has the second highest population in the world, these weapons that can cause a plague in a flash are some of the most deadly things that could ever happen to our country.

Topic 2: Youth, disarmament, and non-proliferation

The Republic of India calls upon its fellow states to employ more of the youth in modern affairs. More than 50% of the population of India is below the age of 25 and 65% is below the age of 35. Just by not having youth in politics, or having age requirements, are stopping a major amount of the population from having any major say in the discussions happening today. With the talks of disarmament and non-proliferations in the future, these people are the generation that will be affected the most. Speaking of which, India calls for a disarmament, and has been calling for it for some time. Though some might say that is a funny thing to be calling for as a nuclear state. But this is the reason that it is calling for it. India knows the dangers of a nuclear war, with heavy conflicts with other states, it seems like India is in the forefront of the major nuclear conflicts. All of these tensions could be dealt with much better and more efficiently if there were not a threat of destruction looming over all of our shoulders.
