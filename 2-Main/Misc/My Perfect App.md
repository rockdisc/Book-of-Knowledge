## File Manager 

I want to be able to manage the files in my entire pc in this while also being able to focus in on one or two folders. I should be able to open files in here, opening them in their default application unless I right click them to open in a specific application. 

## Notetaking 
Be in markdown but also have a different file type that can do canvas like notes. It should be able to render LATEX within the markdown files. It should have double square bracket note linking. There should be tags and a GUI note moving, There should be live preview on editing mode. Allow for good table management so adding and removing rows and columns should be easy. It should take the word count of the entire file unless I highlight something, in which case it should only take into account what is highlighted. Allow pdf editing. Allow for me to put pictures in my notes. Allow for banners. Fully customizable UI. Have it be able to sync with git. Allow for word tracking between files to have a total words typed counter. Allow for homepage functionality.
