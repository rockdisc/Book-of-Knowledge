It has to be able to play my albums at the level of something like AIMP. It should be able to crossfade into other tracks. Play multiple tracks at the same time through a right click menu. It should just play one track if it is a left click. It should play .mp3 files. It should have good organization and let me duplicate the files easily to add them to playlists. I should also be able to add songs that are singles instead of a full album. Albums should be my folders where I keep the music.
